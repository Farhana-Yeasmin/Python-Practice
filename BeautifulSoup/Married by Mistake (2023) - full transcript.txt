[groans] [♪♪♪] [shrieking] - Hi. - Hi. - Sorry. - What? - What? - Where are we? Oh... [♪♪♪] We're in Vegas. Vegas? We're in Vegas. There's a ring on my finger. Oh, no. Wait, did we get married? To finally getting that MBA! Whoo! MBA! Step one... Graduate business school. Step two... Conquer the world! [Nate] Think big, win big! My girl Riley is going to dazzle Beacon America with her marketing prowess! Yeah, I'll be lucky if I'm even noticed there, so. Would you rather go on a date with that handsome, strapping gentleman over there, or Nate? Okay, well, that's not really fair, because that guy's super-hot, and Nate's a nice guy. "Beacon America CFO arrested." "A grand jury has indicted the CFO of a sporting-goods giant, Beacon America, for embezzling $80 million "over the past five years." - [gasps] - Wait, what? No. Okay, so all hiring is on hold? Right, I was supposed to start next week, so that can't be. I would... Hello? You look like you needed some "compny". "Compa-nee." Thanks, Nate, but I don't really feel like talking. You know, I just want what everyone else wants. I want a job that doesn't suck. And I want to pay off my loans, and I want maybe a house. I don't know. I don't need, like, a white picket fence or a Lexus in the driveway with a ribbon. What are you going to do? My family business is going through a rough patch. Dad's counting on me to come home, help turn things around. They could use a dose of what you've got. She spent years trying to get me to become a doctor. Why didn't you? Vasovagal syncope. You mean something's wrong down there? What? No. "Vasovagal" means that my blood pressure drops. I faint when I experience trauma, I guess. Like if you see blood? Yeah. Yeah, I'm just down. Blood, fear. Anything, really, that triggers my fight-or-flight reflex. The last thing you want is boring. Really? To not being boring! [♪♪♪] [vomiting] It's nice to see the idea of marrying me makes you nauseous. Not nauseous. Nauseated. I mean, just, like, I'm not this girl. I don't get blacked out in Vegas and get married. You know, I'm the girl who gets locked in the library because I was studying too long. Yeah, I don't do this stuff either. I've been dating the same girl my whole life. It's my high-school girlfriend. We broke up after graduation and got back together senior year of college, and we've been trying to make it work long-distance ever since, actually. That sounds really complicated, and I feel like we should unpack that at a different time. Yeah. Look, I don't understand. How could this happen? I don't know, Nate. I don't know. The last thing I remember is you were you were trying to convince me to help turn your family business around. [laughs] Yeah, that was silly, huh? Oh, my god, my family, they're gonna freak out. I mean, we have to get divorced. - Right. - Yeah. Yeah. - We have to... - Right. Although, if you think about it, it's not that silly at all. Not the marriage part. We'll obviously get it annulled. Obviously. But you're smart and resourceful. That's exactly the kind of exec we need. What? Riley, just I'm telling you, it's a big opportunity. If you'd just take the time to consider what I'm saying. Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on. Are you asking me for real? Yes, I am. No, I'm a west-coast girl. You know? I like to go hiking in Marin. And eat pork buns at Wing Lee's. I don't think I'm gonna fit in with your little family business in Tennessee. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. If you change your mind, there'll be a ticket waiting for you. If I were doing a case-method analysis, (I would say that a) It's a legit job offer, (and b) the cost of living is way cheaper than here. Plus, Nate's kinda cute. Okay, well, my response would be (a) I don't need a guy to make me happy, (and b) It was a mistake! Doesn't look like a mistake. Hell, this thing looks real. I doubt it. I think he got it at, like, a drive-through chapel. I'm so proud of you. You finally did something spontaneous. Hey, thank you so much. Girl, I love you, but you can't plan every minute of your life. "It takes courage to grow up and become who you really are." Are you throwing Oprah at me right now? No. E e cummings. Oh, that's it. Oprah said, "You get in life what you have the courage to ask for." Okay, what does that have to do with this ring? Maybe it's time to stop planning. Do something outrageous. Like move to Tennessee and work for a mom and pop company? Would you rather move you and Herb back home with your parents? [♪♪♪] I got a call from your Aunt Joan. She says your cousin Kaitlyn just bought a new home. With a guest house for Aunt Joan. Wow. Kaitlyn must be doing very well. Yeah, Mom, surgeons make good money. Let's eat! Dad, where did you get that shirt? My AP Bio class gave it to me. Did they give you those shoes? No, no. Knock-offs. I got 'em at BuyRite. Ugh. What's wrong with BuyRite? Well, they underpay their employees, their stuff is cheap because it's cheaply-made. Listen to you, who buys half her clothes at thrift shops. Not thrift. It's vintage. Don't worry, Suzanne, from now on, Riley's gonna get me all the sneakers I need at Beacon. Yeah, so, um... Oh, yeah, it won't be long before you're running that whole company. Am I right? And don't forget to bring Aunt Joan a nice gift when you get to L.A. Why, Mom? It is the right thing to do. Mom, you have to stop comparing me to Kaitlyn. Joan does the comparing. She forgets that your brother would've been... A great doctor, yeah. Okay, we both know how hard you work. No daughter makes her parents prouder. Aside from Kaitlyn, of course. [chuckles] Come on! Mom. Mom? When the time is right, I promise I will be happy to have you move in with me. Not without a guest house. We need our privacy. Your father can get loud. - Ew. - It's true. - Stop. - She probably knows already. I mean I don't even know why I'm considering it. I don't know anything about them. Nate's family probably says stuff like "what needs washed?" And they probably love Miracle Whip. And you know how I feel about Miracle Whip. But Mom and Dad want me to be a big success. Yeah, I know. I wish you could give me a sign.

I'll just take a chocolate shake, please. Uh-huh. It's my it's my first visit to Cedar Falls. It's... it's nice. It's quiet. The people seem friendly, though. You know that studies show the reason that people from small towns are friendlier isn't altruism. It's actually necessity. Yeah, because, you know, due to the small population, it's more likely they'll, you know, need help in the future. Do you always use scientific data to lure people into conversations? Not always. Is that a turtle? Oh, yeah. That's Herb. When I was little, they didn't allow dogs in my apartment complex, so I got Herb. He's a good listener. You just take him around everywhere you go? No, of course not. But I can't exactly leave him in the car with my luggage. Well, I probably could. There's no laws against it, which is... Yeah, well, I'm not a monster. So do you live here? I used to live here. Oh. Why'd you leave? Are you a reporter? Here you go. Oh, thank you so much. Oh, actually... It's better for the environment. Thank you. Mm. Sorry. You were just telling me why you left? Actually, I wasn't. I feel like you were. I created a financial services app in Seattle. I got married, divorced, sold the app, and I came back home. Doesn't sound like it was your idea. My grandmother wields guilt like a samurai sword. That's lovely. My mom's a stealth fighter... But in pink butterfly scrubs. Success depends on a company's willingness to evolve. You know, we need diverse voices, young voices in the boardroom to connect with the consumers. Nothing's going to change until someone like me has a seat at the table. My dad and I didn't connect, and it's only gotten worse since he married someone 10 years younger than me. But every summer, my mom would take me camping to the Smoky Mountains. We would sit by the fire and talk for hours. Some nights, when I look up at the sky, I feel like I'm back there with her, under all those stars. Sometimes, I feel like it was my fault. You know, if I hadn't asked my brother, Danny, to take me to the mall... Yeah, sometimes, I just feel like she wishes he was the one that was alive. I'm sorry, I'm rambling. You're awfully nice to listen to me. I'm not being nice. Studies show I'm just worried I might need something from you someday. You you have an eyelash right there. Make a wish. [cell phone rings] Sorry. Yes? Can't it wait? Okay, fine. I said, fine. Sorry, I I got to go... Riley. Riley. I'm going to say something that I never say. I think you're an amazing woman, and I can't imagine spending the rest of my life without you. [♪♪♪] ♪ Ooh, baby ♪ I think I'm falling in love ♪ Ooh, baby... [needle scratching record] Riley? Yeah? I was just saying, I don't usually enjoy meeting, well, anyone, but it was really nice talking to you. Yeah. See you, Herb. I don't understand it. Now is when I should be building my career, you know? Not just fantasizing about some stranger. Plus, I don't need a guy... To make you happy. Yeah, yeah. Aren't you there yet? I'm lost. You know, I don't know if this is a good idea. I'm not sure how I'm going to fit in here. Then don't. "Why fit in when you were born to stand out?" Maya Angelou? Dr. Seuss. Um, I gotta go. Okay, love you. Bye. No, I know, I know. So I said to him, "Carl, if you wanna go drinkin' after work, least you can do is pick up the kids from school. Hell, I don't care if you take 'em with you, "as long as I don't hafta get 'em." Oh! I'll call you back. You must be Riley! Nate told me to keep an eye out for ya. That Marie Kondo says to surround yourself with things that bring you joy. 'Mingos bring me joy. [laughs] Come on. - I love your suit. - Thank you. [man] I'm tired of you questioning everything I say. In case you haven't noticed, I am in charge here, so pack up your crap and get the hell out of here. You're fired! [woman sighs] Hey, Ma. Don't you look nice, Mother Faye. Pretty as a peach in June. I see we lost another Marketing VP. All he did was gripe about his budget. I told him how to save money. I told him to use Kaylee in the campaign. Used car dealers feature their wives in ads, not national brands. I do have my own YouTube channel. Don't you have somewhere to be? Son, we are already facing another quarter in the red. Your daddy would be so disappointed. Look all you want, Ma. You won't find him up there. This young lady's here to see Nate. He said to bring her in here. Uh. This is probably a mistake. I'm looking for Nate Fisher. That's my grandson. Nathaniel Fisher Bynam. I'm his dad, Nathaniel Sr., but 'round here everybody calls me "Buck". Bynam? As in the owners of... BuyRite Department Stores? Hi. Sorry, I was on a conference call. Riley, are you okay? BuyRite is your family business? Yeah. Oh! Winnie! Herb! Herb! Did you catch Herb? - [Nate] He's fine. - He's okay? [Nate] Yeah. I think you had one of those vegan-bagel things. Vasovagal. Yes, thank you. I thought you said that your last name was "Fisher". I used my mom's name in school to attract less attention. Gotcha. So, son, you wanna catch us up here? Yeah, Dad, this is Riley Smith. We went to business school together. [Riley] Hi. And this is my grandmother, Faye. Hi. - Welcome to Cedar Falls. - Thank you. So you're here for a visit? Yeah. Well, actually, she came to live. We're married. I thought that you said we were getting an annulment. I'm sorry I blindsided you with all that. Dad's been acting so erratic, the board froze all hiring. So, the only way to bring you in is if we stay married just for a little longer. BuyRite? I don't agree with any of BuyRite's policies. At all. Then help change them. Look, BuyRite used to be a great place to work. But the industry's changed. Since Mom died, we've had to close 80 stores. We're not done. Well, you obviously can't shut down Boise. There's nothing for 50 miles. You'd just be turning your backs on the customers who need you the most, and you'll be creating a PR nightmare. - You see? - Do not look at me like that. You understand both sides. We'd offer a generous salary. Living rent-free with me, you could pay off your loans in no time. Are you trying to bribe me? No. - 'Cause it's working. - Great. Oh, it's working. No, it can't work. I can't work for BuyRite. This is. I can't go to my parents. My dad might not be able to work much longer. - Welcome back. - Emily! Oh, someone's working out? Oh, it's just some interval training. - Hi. - Hi. I'm Emily. Director of Corporate Communications and Promotions. Oh, nice to meet you. And Nate's old girlfriend. I'm Riley. I'm... Nate's wife, I guess. You're married? It was very impromptu. Musta been. You didn't even have time to get her a ring. Uh, yeah I actually have it. It's in her purse, yeah. It was just getting resized. Traveling, so. Yup. Nate actually has said a lot about you. - Really? - Yeah. He never mentioned you. [Winnie speaks on intercom] Nate, can you tell Emily another bouquet arrived from Andrew? That boy is such a cutie-patootie. [Nate] Thank you, Winnie. Andrew Baker? High-school football captain. Yeah. He's... so thoughtful. You know, we should go to dinner. The four of us. Yeah. It would be fun, right? Yeah. Great! [♪♪♪] [Riley] This is where you grew up? [Nate] Look, I know that was a lot for everyone. They just need a chance to get to know you better. We're normal. They'll love you. You're normal? Yeah. There's, like, 15 garages here. 14. It's called "Find Your Bliss With Kaylee Bynam." So I get my squad together, and we talk about female empowerment. You know, like being responsible for your own orgasm. Mother Faye, there's nothing wrong with enjoying sex. My dear, I was owning my own orgasm long before you were born. Some things are best left to yourself. I also bring on guests. Last week, I talked to a girl who writes sci-fi erotica. And not just Captain Kirk getting it on with Mr. Spock. Classy stuff. Okay, so it's a video podcast and people subscribe to it also? From all over. Even men in prison. Especially men in prison. Yeah, maybe that's enough talk about the podcast, babe. I'd like to propose a toast. Nate, I'm real proud of you. Sorry I couldn't make it to the graduation. Thanks, Dad. It's good to be home again. We're in this together. - Cheers. - Cheers. I don't know why you had to get married so fast. No family. I couldn't move back without her. Riley's very special to me. Well, now, that doesn't explain why I understand that BuyRite's been around for over 60 years? So what was your focus at Stanford? Socially-conscious marketing. Really? What is socially-conscious marketing? It's a lot of nonsense, that's what. Honey... No, it's a... It allows consumers to connect with companies in a more meaningful way. So, like Verizon with women in tech, or Dove's positive-body-image ads. That's the fatties in the underwear, right? Really, it's a load of woke PR is what it is. I think companies have a responsibility to better society in any way that they can. My company provides jobs. We don't get anywhere near enough credit for that. You do get tax breaks, though, which leaves towns with less money for schools and emergency services. What Riley's trying to say is our brand needs a makeover. Her perspective will be valuable to our marketing department. [Buck] Will be? You just hold on a minute there, son. [Faye] I think the company could use a fresh pair of eyes. [♪♪♪] You know, BuyRite obviously can't compete with online companies offering free delivery, so. There's a news flash. You're saying we should concentrate on bringing customers into the stores? [Nate] Yes. Cedar Falls used to be one of our best outlets, but it just had its worst quarter in five years. Now, if you're talkin' about give-aways... It's not about gimmicks, Dad. We need to revitalize the brand. You know, improve the retail experiences, bringing in younger customers. There's a lot of room to pair with social-media influencers. I'll give you Cedar Falls. Mother... Come up with a plan to turn things around and we'll talk. And because leadership skills are important, I've asked Rhys to return. [Nate] What? What, Rhys is joining BuyRite? Just to keep the Board happy. Once we're back on solid ground, he can go where he damn well pleases. Who's Rhys? I told you about Rhys. Remember? You didn't know that Nate had a brother? No. Sorry I missed dinner, Grandma. Hi. [Leila] So let me get this straight Mr. Milkshake, the man of your dreams, is your husband's brother? Yes. Well, no. I don't know. Stop laughing. This isn't funny. Oh, what should I do? Off the top of my head move up the annulment! I can't move it up. Well, because this is kind of interesting. The plan is we have to be working. Plus, his grandma's very cool. [Buck] Riley? Yeah, you gotta go. Mr. Bynam. Hi. I don't know what kind of game you're running here, missy. I think you have the wrong idea. I... You don't have to be a genius to see that Nate's in over his head, so cards on the table. Am I gonna be a grandpa? What? Oh, no. No, no. I'm not pregnant, so. Okay, then I will pay whatever is in your prenup. Uh... Oh, sweet Jesus. Mr. Bynam, I I don't want anything from you. Really. I'm Nate thinks BuyRite is worth saving, and I can help. I'm gonna... Why didn't you tell me who you were? Why didn't you tell me you were married? Oh, it's so nice having my boys back in the house again. You're not afraid we'll end up killing each other? Oh, well, that's a distinct possibility, but it's a risk I'm willing to take. Congrats, by the way. Thank you. I was referring to Nate. Clearly, he got the better end of the deal. [laughs] Why'd you have to go and say that? She thinks I'm a catch. No one thinks you're a catch, Nate. I think you're a catch, Nate. I see you gave her mom's ring. It's not like you were using it. It's good to be home. [♪♪♪] What do you got in there? Sorry. Like, what? Dead bodies. Oh, it's just up here. And off we go. Oh, watch out. - Be careful. - I'm okay! [♪♪♪] [exhales] Okay everything's set up. You can take the guest room. - Okay. - Unless you want to sleep in... No, no. 'Cause married people, they stay in the same bedroom. We're not really married. That's... The guest room is perfect. Thank you. This is your mom's ring. You didn't mention that. [sighs] Thank you for trusting me with this while we you know, do this. It's really... Not a problem. It was for Emily, huh? Were you going to propose? We've been trying to keep things going long-distance. She was supposed to fly out for graduation, but she called the night before, and said she'd met someone else. Oh! Okay. That's why you got so drunk. She was tired of being taken for granted. She said, um she said I didn't appreciate her enough. She was right. I blew it. Okay, Nate, it's... No, Riley, it's fine. She moved on. So should I. You know, I could probably get a plant or two in here. You know, warm up the space. I don't plan on staying here long. Have you done any work in sales? Well, I worked at Urban Outfitters when I was a teenager during the summer. - Does that count? - [Nate] Yeah. So she knows how to up sell stoners. It's perfect for us. I don't think you understand what you're getting yourself into. My dad is looking for anyone to blame. And he's a bit unhinged. I think I can handle myself, Rhys. I have an MBA. [Nate] Why do you always attack him? Why do you always defend him? You know he's been this way since we were kids. He thinks the world is against him. Seventh grade, summer camp, laser tag, no one wanted to be on his team because if poor, little Rhysie didn't win, he was furious. He'd always complain that his vest wasn't working. My vest was not working. No matter how many times he got hit, he always refused to leave the game. Faulty vest. I guess some people expect a trophy just for showing up. [intercom beeps] [Winnie] Rhys, your father wants to see you. Well, that went well. Well there's something you don't see much around here. Yeah. No, no, don't, don't. They're beautiful. I'm Demarcus. From Operations. Riley. Nice to meet you. Um. Well, how can I help you? Well, Nate wants you to go undercover, scope out the Cedar Falls store. Oh, okay. Well, um let me check my schedule. She says, pretending she has a schedule. Sorry, yeah. Undercover? That's... that's exciting. Do I have, like... Like a back story? Or a disguise? Simmer down, Veronica Mars. I told the manager you've been transferred from Memphis. And you'll wear these. Okay. Okay. I know, honey. Don't even try to explain it. It's a waste of time. Like watching golf, or eating kale. My theory is, they designed them back in the '70s to prevent workers from hooking up. I'm guessing it worked out pretty well. Enjoy! Nice to meet you! [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [man] Heads-up! Kenny! Knock it off, man! Sorry, Maria! Cooler display! Aisle 12. Let's go! Yeah, but I was just... No, no, no! O te patearé tu trasero. All right, boss. [speaks in Spanish] Okay! Come on, let's go. Well, he responds to "I'll kick your ass," so that's... that's good. He's a good kid. You just need to know how to reach him. Got it. - Riley? - Yes, sorry. - Hi. - Hola. I'm Maria. The manager's not here so I'll take you around. - Great. - Come this way. Now, that was Kenny, and he's not gonna change. [Riley] Okay. We like to rotate the newbies through each department. Unfortunately, we have a high turnover rate. You see, morale isn't exactly high. Josh! Becca! Man, where is everyone? Kenny! Kenny! No, no, no, no! That's going to... - Whoops. - Fall. As I was saying, we have pretty good barbecues, lawnmowers. Can't stand to lose, huh? Have you met Riley's parents? Not yet. What about siblings? I think she's an only child. How much do you know about her? We've been friends for two years. You really think it was a good idea, surprising Dad like that? Yeah. He'll come around. You always did believe in miracles. [girl] I'm hungry. I want these cookies. You can't keep taking cookies from the shelves. - Hi. - Hi. Who's this? She was separated from her family. Oh, no. Hi. What's your name? Amalia. Amalia? Okay. I'm sure we can find them somewhere. They're probably not far Riley, why don't you take a break for lunch? I'll go find her mom. - Oh, are you sure? - Yeah. Of course. - Okay. - Thanks. Come on. - Bye. - Bye. Hello there! Hi. I'm Ted, the store manager. Right. - Hi. - Hi. If I'd have known you were this pretty, I would have been here a lot sooner. Well, Maria's been doing a really good job, so. Yeah, she's pretty good for a part-timer. Love her spunk. Yeah, that's good to know Ted. [Riley] I mean, the store's a mess, and Ted, he... That man sucks. Yeah, that's a non-starter. Ted is Faye's nephew. What? That's the only reason he's had this job for so long. So, a little birdie told me that you got off on the wrong foot with Buck. Yeah. Word of advice... Don't poke the bear, honey. That could prove dangerous. Well... Oh, you're not in Kansas anymore, Dorothy. And I sure as hell ain't the wizard. That's too bad... There's a pair of ruby slippers in footwear. Just my size. I am so sorry. I'm not talking about a complete restructuring. I'm just saying if you pay people like Maria what she's actually worth, then it would be... Do you know how much it would cost to provide benefits to part-timers? Well, she's not actually part-time. You guys just call her that because it's a way I don't call it anything. I'm just here on a temporary basis, and as soon as things get in shape... You will be on your way. Yes. I'm aware. You should just take it off. The stain's gonna set. You know, so you can soak it, or the shirt will be ruined. Okay... Okay, well... Oh, I'm not gonna do it. You can. Take this. Here, you... You can just scrub it. Well, don't scrub it. Dab it. Ahem. What's going on? Um. I had the coffee and... She came around the corner, and then the... - The stain... - All over it, so we're just... Dad and I decided. We're closing ten more stores. Including Boise. Okay, then. By the way, your wedding announcement's gonna be in Sunday's paper. Yeah. Nate. My parents don't know yet. It's the "Cedar Falls Chronicle". They'll never see it, okay? Can I, uh, get my shirt back? Yeah. Here you go. Um, I'm gonna... You can... yeah. [Leila] You always do this. Do what? Miss the cues. Remember that professor? He just gave me his umbrella. During a thunderstorm. You're ridiculous. And what about that waiter? You really think he comped our entire table just 'cause your fish was dry? Leila, I know what you're doing and it's not going to work. You know, you're trying to make this into something it's not. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Hey. Uh. Hello. Hi. That used to be one of my favorite books when I was your age. Um, so you're not... You're not lost again, right? No. Okay, well, enjoy the book. Bye. [♪♪♪] Okay, so we've got the ad guys in New York and then we'll meet with the regional managers on the way home. We should only be gone a week. Okay. Don't worry. You're not missing out on anything. It'll just be one boring meeting after another. Oh, yeah. I'm not worried. You sure you'll be all right on your own? Yeah. I'll be fine. - For a week? - Yeah. - Okay. - Okay. Bye. I... um... Give me a kiss. Come on. [Riley] What are you doing? Give me a kiss. Please? I'll get the door for you. - Thanks. - Right. [Riley] Okay, fly safe. [Nate] Yup. 'Kay. Bye. [exhales] [Riley] I don't care if something happens between them. Plus, you know, Nate never said that I couldn't explore my options, so. No, I can't come clean to Rhys, because then I will blow this whole thing. Plus, I don't even know if he feels the same way. I just. I don't know. What do you think? You're absolutely no help. Agh! Oh... That's... That's... Oh, I'm feeling dizzy. [line ringing] Hey. Hey, so this is silly, but I I cut my finger and, and I'm just calling because you know, there's there is so much blood in the radio. [♪♪♪] Hey. Hey there. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have called you. No, no. Don't apologize. I was just afraid it might look like a crime scene. Thank you a lot for... What? Nothing. Uh. I think this is yours. Thanks. Is that your brother? Yeah, that's Daniel. Well, let's... let's get you up. Yeah. Sure you're okay? Yes. I'm... Yeah, I'm okay. No more... No more sharp knives, okay? Copy that. You know, when in doubt, PB&J is always a safer bet. - Okay. - Okay. Take good care of her, Herb. Bye. Hi. Hey. - Oh, do you want... - Yes. How was... How was your weekend? It was good. How was... how was yours? Well, I had a near-death experience, but, luckily, I was rescued by a very swift-moving, good doctor. Looks like he did a good job. Yeah. You know what when we met, we. Kind of hit it off. And now things are very awkward, and I just don't want I don't want this to affect work and stuff. No. Thanks for inviting me to dinner. Thank you. Wow, this is amazing. Well, it may be the boonies, but we know how to live well. What have you learned about our flagship store? Uh, well morale is incredibly low. But there is this exceptional employee. Her name is Maria Mercado. She's she's motivated, she's responsible, she's honestly, everything you want in a store manager. And look, I know that Ted is your nephew... Ted's an idiot, but he's family. We'll find something else for him. Will all due respect, ma'am, it's a much bigger issue than Cedar Falls. When I walk into BuyRite, back in San Francisco, I feel like I'm walking back into the '80s. The company needs a serious update. It needs new systems, new marketing, it... How did it get this bad? My husband didn't always trust Buck very much. But he respected Elizabeth. She understood the business, shared his desire for Rhys and Nate to run it one day. After she died, it all fell apart. Having the boys here helps, but Nate is like his dad. He always does better if he has someone to... Help him see the big picture? It isn't always easy meeting up to family expectations, but you and Nate would make an effective team. If that's what you really want. You wanted to see me? I hear you've been helping Riley get the lay of the land. Oh, yes, indeed. She wants to learn as much as possible about BuyRite. Oh, I bet she does. Now, listen. I need you to do something for me. If you deliver, it could be good for the both of us, hmm? Come on. So, you want to go around Buck and get Faye to approve your plans? He is convinced that I'm pretending to like Nate so I can maneuver my way into the executive suite. [Leila laughs] Yeah, I know it looks like that, but we both know it's not. Where are you? At the store. The alarm went off. Maria said that birds have been triggering the sensor thing, so I told Nate that I'd check it out. You can come home, you know. You don't have anything to prove. No, that's not it. I just need to prove to Faye that I know what I'm doing. It's all locked up, Miss Smith. Great. Plus, once we get Cedar Falls up and running, we can use it as a nation-wide model. You know? And this sales associate, Maria Mercado? She's incredible. She's young, she's dedicated. She's the perfect image for the future of the company. [thumping] Maybe you should get behind me. I... I gotta go. [♪♪♪] [Maria] I feel awful about this. Here you go. Oh, gracias. - Have a good night. - You too. Thanks. I started working at BuyRite since high school. I was planning to go to community college, but then I got pregnant with Amalia. Did you take maternity leave? We don't get maternity. They said I could take two weeks unpaid. - What? - Mm-hmm. Any more than that, they'd fire me. So I took two weeks. Do you have any, like, family that could help out, or? Um, we'd been living with my mom, but she died a few months ago. I just couldn't keep up with rent, so the landlord threw us out. I just I couldn't leave Amalia in a shelter while I worked. Yeah, of course. So we moved into the store. And it never affected my job. It never affected my job. I had a really, really nice neighbor who would watch her during the day. And I would work overtime so I could close up. Maria, have you ever thought about you know, applying to be a manager? You're so good. It... You just need a college degree. Riley I'm gonna share with you what my mom's favorite saying was. You can dress a goat in lace, but you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. So, what she meant was don't try and be something you're not, mi hija. Don't aim too high. I had such dreams for her. I just never thought that we would end up like this. Hi. Can you tell Rhys I need to talk to him ASAP? Thanks. [phone ringing] Mom, Dad. Hey, what's up? You got married? Uh, how did you hear that? [Dad] Aunt Joan sent us a link. She was living in the store? - Why didn't you tell me? - [Mom] Why didn't you tell me? Hold on one second. Rhys, I was going to... [Dad] Oh, Riley, honey, wait. Rhys! Rhys! I... [Mom] Where did she go? [phone buzzes] Hey. How mad is she? Remember when you built that volcano, and Mom warned you not to erupt it inside the house? And ketchup sprayed all over the good carpet? This is worse. Much, much worse. Dad, I was embarrassed when Beacon fell through. I needed a job, and Nate said that it would be easier to bring me into the company if we were married. So you're just pretending? Yeah. It seemed like a good idea at the time. And now it is not working out the way I planned. And I have no idea what to do. Plus, his dad is looking for any way to fire me. Riley, I've never known you to back down from a fight. Don't start now. Thanks. Love you, Dad. I love you, too, Riley. No, I don't care what my father says. We're not doing a stock buy-back. Thank you. [♪♪♪] In all fairness to Buck, a free month of Weight Watchers with every plus-size swimsuit was a good idea. But we should've let customers sign up for it themselves. You try to do something nice. I had no idea she was living in the store. She's a really good person and she's great at what she does. Let me handle it. [Emily] ...It may not be enough to appease to satisfy customers. To help deal with the fallout, PR's brainstorming options like having a brand ambassador do targeted press. I would never do anything to harm this company. Or this family. I believe that. [Emily] ...Plus-size options. And with that, I hand it back to you, Buck. BuyRite began as a family company. Over the years, that family grew. But it gets real complicated when we open the door to someone who's not kin. Now, my father taught me that the most important quality in an employee is loyalty. And it's because of that... We'd like to acknowledge the hard work and sacrifice of all of you who have kept this business going. Mother... It won't be easy to fix what's wrong. But Buck and I have faith in the next generation of Bynams. Right now, Nate, Riley and Rhys are polishing an ambitious plan. And we look forward to unveiling it at the next shareholders' meeting. [Buck] Thank you all for coming. That will be it for today. [♪♪♪] What just happened? I think we got tagged. Okay first thing we do is we expedite the architectural plans. Let's have them mock up a 3D rendering for Faye. And you should talk to Emily. We should run focus groups to improve customer service. Rhys, have Demarcus generate productivity reports so we can expand the departments that are yielding the highest revenue. And then I will review the marketing analytics, and then I'll get started on the mood boards for the new aesthetic. Well, I guess she's running point. [♪♪♪] Okay, so this is just low-tech spitballing, but based off of Emily's promotional ideas, I kind of came up with some temp print ad ideas. This... These are really good. This could work. Yeah. [Emily] Buck won't like it. Yes, I know rebranding BuyRite is like putting socks on a rooster. You've been here too long. [Emily] Damn, so have I. Andrew must be worried sick. Guess we should all head home. [Riley] Well, actually, no. Rhys and I have some budget stuff to go over, so I'll just meet you. All right, yeah. [♪♪♪] Hey. Thank you. You'll need a cost-benefit analysis for that proposal. Okay. And... what's what's this? Oh, um, Demarcus and I, we mocked up a management training program. You know, something employees can do during their lunch break. That's rather ambitious. Yeah, well, you know, shoot for the fences. I'm so tired. Can I show you something? [♪♪♪] My mom created this as a place for employees to escape after a long day. I come up here to think a lot. Smart woman. It's quite the view. Yeah. Daniel used to teach me about the constellations. I wish he was here. But, you know, I think he'd be really proud of what we're doing. Yeah. Look, Riley I know you mean well, but this company... It's a sinking ship. You... you can't save it. So what you've been doing is just humoring me? No, I'm supporting you. I just don't want to see you get your hopes up on this. Okay. Hmm. You know, you can't shut the world out just because things didn't work out the way you planned, right? I actually did my research on you, and when you started your company, the housing market was out of control, so you bought old buildings and you turned them into apartments so that your employees could have more affordable housing. That was purely a business decision. Exactly. Because you know good ethics makes for good business. I'm assuming that your mom taught you that. It is clear that she put her heart and soul into this company, and that is why you came back. Would you want her to see you like this, just counting down the days until you're done? And pretending like you don't care about anything? [♪♪♪] Riley? Riley... [♪♪♪] Oh, crap. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] This all you got? Well, I'm still working on it. Well, work faster. I want her outta here as soon as possible. [singing] ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday, dear Mama ♪ Auntie Faye ♪ Happy birthday to you Thank you! It's beautiful. Looks like you're gonna need a bigger cake next year, Grandma. There's a distinct possibility, but as long as I'm still here, I can cut my own cake. Thank you. [Nate] Let me take the sparklers. [Buck] Don't burn your fingers. How about a big, old corner piece for your favorite nephew? You're my only nephew, Ted. [Riley] Hey. Did you think I wouldn't find out? Uh, what? You tricked Nate into marrying you. You're just after his money. [Riley] That's that's not true. I just don't get why he fell for it. You're not exactly his type. What's going on? This little gold-digger... She's not only flat-broke, she's deep in debt. Her folks don't even own their home. [♪♪♪] Riley. Riley... [♪♪♪] Riley. He's talking about my family. Being in debt. You know that I have an MBA from Stanford? I have a degree from Berkeley, and he's talking about me like I am trash. This isn't about the money, Riley. It's not about the money? What are you talking about? Of course, it's about the money. No. He's afraid of you. [laughs] Okay. Riley, he's afraid that my grandma's going to like your ideas. That... that the Board is going to lose confidence in him and force him out. The Board thinks I am a nobody. They don't care about what I have to say. They don't care. They don't care! They care, Riley, because you have a seat at the table. As Nate's wife, you get a share of the company. [♪♪♪] Look the other night, I... Yeah, I shouldn't have kissed you. Sorry, I... You're the only person since my mom that can actually make a change. We need you here. I need you here. [♪♪♪] Based on our most recent revenue reports, we restructure the stores' layout, making the most successful departments the easiest to access. We also rebranded the grocery department, making it more modern and customer-friendly, with a wide variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, and also a designated area for ready-to-go meals for our busy shoppers. Another feature of our rebrand is the reboot of our displays and our color palette. You know, we want our customers to see that there's been a real change here at BuyRite. So, as you can see, the most requested improvements are flexible returns, scan-and-go checkout, and curbside pick-up. But, at the end of the day, BuyRite's biggest strength is our consumer loyalty. Online surveys show that 68% of customers have been shopping at BuyRite for over 20 years. So, as my mom always says, in any good relationship, it's important to spice things up, remind them why they keep coming back. Very nice. [applause] [Riley] And tomorrow, we'll walk through the store. And behold our fabulous, new produce section. Now, these new shelves have bar code scanners that gauge when supplies are running low, then they notify the associates via an app on their phone. Ted? And when these changes go through, these smart carts will allow customers to upload their shopping lists. The wireless system tracks every item placed in the cart, then allows customers to pay for it directly, this reducing lines at check-out. Plus, they recommend additional items to customers, which increases purchases by 20%. [Emily] And to pay for it, we've partnered with a number of national brands whose products appear on the screen as shoppers move down each aisle. So we've updated our break room, giving employees more reason to eat lunch there, which increases productivity. And we've expanded our management training, creating the Elizabeth Fisher Scholarships, so promising part-timers can finish college and become team leaders. And because we want our employees to be able to take care of their families, we're going to help subsidize the cost of daycare. [Buck] We can't do that. It'll bankrupt us. Too much of our budget goes to recruiting new hires. And research shows that affordable childcare results in lower employee turnover. Very admirable. Screw admirable. Mama, do you have any idea how much that will cost? Well, some of it will be offset by the free publicity we'll get. Emily's put together a nationwide campaign. Live Right, BuyRite. [Riley] People want to feel good about the purchases they're making, and that loyalty is passed on to their children. So you're really going to indulge them in this bleeding-heart crap? [Riley] Launching BuyRite required a big leap of faith. And we are asking you to do that again... Trust us to win over the trust of the new generation. An excellent execution of a plan. Well done, everyone! [applause] Uh-uh-uh-uh! What the hell was that? What? You didn't like it? We agreed. You were going to sabotage them. I paid you plenty. Yes, you did. But Rhys paid me more. [chuckles] Oh, yeah? Chip off the old block. They loved it. Oh, Riley, I'm so proud of you. You haven't talked to Rhys yet? I don't know if there's any point. He's convinced himself he doesn't care. But you think he does? I know it sounds corny, but I really do believe that true love is your soul's recognition of its counterpoint in another. Emily Dickinson? Wedding Crashers. I should go. Nate's taking me to dinner at the country club. Oh! Okay. - Try to have fun. - Yes. Oh. Hey. You're in love with my grandson, aren't you? Just not the one you're married to. Uh... You do know that as long as you're with Nate, he won't admit his feelings. [♪♪♪] You brought me as your guest to make Emily jealous, right? No. Really? You didn't want to make her angry so she'd come crawling back? Okay, maybe, but, look, she doesn't love me anymore, so. Are you sure about that? Surprise! [applause] Wasn't me. What? Rhys thought of it. Since you never had a proper reception. Enjoy yourself. Thank you. Faye looks about as happy as a tick on a fat dog. Come here. - Oh. - Come on.

You know, I didn't want you to be disappointed. We're not disappointed, we're just surprised. Me too. This is a surprise. Rhys flew us first-class... With fresh-baked cookies.

Oh, I've missed our little chats. Why don't I get us a drink? - Yes. Great. - Let's do it. Enjoy. [♪♪♪] I'm. I'm so happy you're here. Yeah, it was really sweet of Rhys to do all of this for you. Yeah, it is. You know, my parents didn't want me to follow your father to San Francisco. For months, they wouldn't even use his name, they just calling him "Him". Really? They thought I was making a big mistake. But I went anyway. Because I loved him. And right after I got accepted to med school, I got pregnant with Daniel. So I put it off. And by the time you came, it was too far out of reach. Why didn't you tell me? Because it was my choice. I had a good job, a good marriage, and two healthy children. That's what mattered. Honey, I'm proud of you. But I can't watch you lie to yourself. Not about something this important. Trust me, I'm your mother, and I love you. Come here. [♪♪♪] Hey. - You guys having a good time? - Yes! Yeah. Oh, your father and I are going to take a spin on the dance floor. - Oh! Oh, yes. - Mm-hmm. - Yes, I promised her a dance. - That's right. On the dance floor. Over here. Have fun. You made quite the impression on my mother. She can never fly Economy Plus again. Thank you. And you know, thank you for all of this. Really really nice. It's the least we can do to welcome you to the family. Actually, I wanted to tell you something. [Faye] Check, check. Ladies and gentlemen, I think it's time to toast the happy couple. Oh, my god. [Faye] Riley. - Riley. - [Riley] That's okay. Here you go, sweetheart. Here you go. Hey. Oh. Um, hi, everybody. Thank you guys for being here. [man] Speech! [Riley] Okay, yeah, speech. You know, my dad always says, "Family is where life starts and love never ends." He probably got it off of a meme. He spends way too much time on Instagram. Um, but it's true. I'm really lucky to have parents who care about me. Even when they expect a lot from me. I still feel their love. And I'm so grateful to be embraced by this new family. And I... There's just. I haven't been completely honest with you guys. Or myself, really. And there's something that I wanted to say. Yeah, so I... Emily. It's you. It's always been you. This thing with Riley, it was a mistake. We were drunk, we didn't even realize what we were doing 'til it was too late. I'm sorry, Emily. I was a fool. When you left me for Andrew, I was afraid... You're right. You are a fool. I broke up with Andrew weeks ago. You did? I love you so much. I love you, too. How could you do this to Riley? After everything she's done! Hey, hey. Wait, wait. No, no, stop. I know that he doesn't love me. It's okay. You do? Yeah. I don't love him either. So this was just a big joke? Nate's my friend. A big game? No. This is what I was trying to tell you. You don't understand... No, you know what, I understand that the more time I spend here, I remember why I left. Rhys, wait. Wait! [Faye moaning] [Faye moaning] Yeah, Nate said Faye's doing better, so that's... [sighs] That's good. The doctors, they agreed to private home care. Um, but she could be convalescing for a while. [Mom] Sounds like she'll be okay. Have you heard from Rhys? Um. No. [♪♪♪] - Hi! - Riley! I got you something. Thank you, Riley! You're welcome, sweetheart. What's this? Just something to get you started. [chuckles] [♪♪♪] Gracias! You're welcome. [♪♪♪] [moans] - Hey. - Hey. How is she? She's drifting in and out. Is that Riley? Hi! Are you leaving? Yeah. Are you insane? - Grandma! Not again! - She's done this before? Many times. Well, someone has to knock some sense into you! Auntie Faye... You're okay? Ted make yourself useful and get me a bourbon on the rocks. Yes, ma'am. And as for you... Where I come from, we fight for what we want. Not run away from it with our tail between our legs. [Riley] I Rhys doesn't want anything to do with me, so. He doesn't know what he wants. He's too busy running away from this town, this family. He needs something... Someone to believe in. I don't know where I'd find him. You know. What are you waiting for? Go find him! Really? You heard her. What are you waiting for? Go find him. Okay. I don't think she's gonna find him. [group] Shut up, Ted. [phone ringing] Hi! [♪♪♪] Okay. Thank you. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Hi. - Hi. - So, um... All my life, I've I've lived up to these expectations of my friends, my family myself, and you're the first person in a long time who has seen me for exactly who I am. And didn't expect a thing. I do see you. For the first time in a long time, I feel like someone sees me, too, and I realize how rare that is. I Hired a lawyer. I can't stay married to Nate. Why not? Because I love you. I love you, too. [♪♪♪] - Let's make a wish. - Okay. You're still here. Yeah, I figured I'd stick around a while. You're not gonna faint again, are you? No. Good, 'cause I I have a surprise.
