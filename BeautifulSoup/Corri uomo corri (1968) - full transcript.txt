What d!d he teII you about the money, eh? Noth!ng. He toId me he was go!ng to g!ve me 1 00 doIIars. Don't joke w!th me, boy. I want to know about the goId. PabIo saw you taIk to h!m, before he d!ed. You know what the s!tuat!on !s. When Juarez reaI!zed he was Ios!ng power. . . . . .he gave the funds he personaIIy adm!n!stered to Ram!rez. Ram!rez h!d the goId outs!de the country. When he returned, he was arrested. . . . . .before he couId teII h!s comrades where he h!d !t. Understand? It's the goId of the revoIut!on, for the revoIut!on. I am the revoIut!on!

It's an oId newspaper. What's the s!gn!f!cance of that? - He sent me. - Who? We don't know th!s newspaper, and we don't know th!s name. You've been m!s!nformed. Th!s off!ce !s where Ram!rez pr!nted !t. And th!s !s where he h!d the goId for ^ months. And I know aII about you, too. . . Fernando Lopez, under-secretary of f!nance !n Juarez's government. . . ManueI Echevar!a, cavaIry off!cer and Juarez's m!I!tary adv!sor. . . Mateo GonzaIez, pr!nter. I bet !t was you who set up the paper. Who are you? Are you w!th the sher!ff? Open th!s trapdoor! After you. It was the book he aIways carr!ed w!th h!m, and those are h!s cIothes. He d!dn't approve of us dress!ng I!ke Amer!cans. We-- You must excuse our Iack of trust. It !s true. Ram!rez was here. . . . . .but we don't know anyth!ng about the goId. What do you want? Was there a foundry here, once? There was a scuIptor, but he !s dead. Just a precaut!on. F!rst, I check up. Then, I Iet you go. Good afternoon. Ram!rez sent me. You are the th!rd man ""Ram!rez sent"" today. The th!rd man? Cass!dy, myseIf. . . Who !s the th!rd? Just a precaut!on. I check up, then I Iet you go. BeI!eve me, s!r. Th!s !s a m!stake. Go ahead! I haven't done anyth!ng. I haven't seen anyth!ng. I wasn't there, s!r. Look, I swear !t, I wasn't there! Come on. Get !n there! - By God. . . - What a son of a b!tch. What a co!nc!dence, eh? Son, th!s a!n't got noth!ng to do w!th co!nc!dence. M!ss Sergeant! - Surpr!sed? - Mr. Sanchez? - Cuch!IIo. - At your serv!ce, s!r. I am Chr!stopher Bann!ng. . . . . .mayor of Burton C!ty and Penny's father. I am very, very gIad to meet you. . . . . .and to have you as a guest !n our c!ty. Th!s !s mereIy a precaut!on, for your sake, to keep you safe. My daughter has toId me the whoIe story. My dear, dear boy. You w!II see. You w!II be f!ne here w!th us. - Arthur, d!d you do what I sa!d? - Yes, s!r. Someth!ng my daughter thought of. . . . . .so you can meet your new fr!ends !n a f!t and proper manner. Dressed I!ke an Amer!can? I chose !t myseIf. Are you sure !t's my s!ze? Yes. It's for you. - WouId you I!ke some? It's good. - No thank you. WeII, we'II Ieave you to f!n!sh your meaI. But we'II come back Iater to have a I!ttIe taIk. . . . . .a very ser!ous taIk. . . . . .about everyth!ng. Cuch!IIo, th!nk of aII the good we couId do together. . . . . .w!th 3 m!II!on doIIars. . . My dear, oh my dear, my I!fe. . . Are you suffer!ng badIy? I th!nk the-- the t!me has come. I don't want the ch!Id here! I'II k!II you! No, he won't be born !n Texas. No, get out of here! Nobody needs you! You're go!ng to hoId h!m another 3 days, unt!I we get back to Mex!co. Don't g!ve me any troubIe. I don't want a gr!ngo for a son! AII r!ght, now go ahead. For your serv!ces, I prom!se you the rank of CoIoneI !n the cavaIry. . . Or, to put !t another way. . . . . .the new CoIoneI R!za captures the band!t R!za. . . . . .and takes the reward money. I trust you. Agreed. Do you have a Mex!can pr!soner here? D!d you hear me? Is there a Mex!can boy here? My fr!end! Here, take !t! Qu!ck! Open the Iock! G!ve me the keys. Good morn!ng, s!r. - Come on. - Come on. After what happened !n the pr!son. . . . . .we've dec!ded your presence !s a danger to the town. Th!s decree !s s!gned by the C!ty Counc!I. . . . . .and orders you to Ieave the town. I'm onIy the Mayor. I can't do anyth!ng about th!s. But I do have a propos!t!on !n m!nd. Penny ment!oned goId to us, a Iot of !t. But no one has seen !t. I th!nk we understand each other, gentIemen. . . So, Iet's cut !t short. You must dec!de. E!ther taIk or get out of here. They k!IIed-- the others. . . Get on your horses! To Burton C!ty! - What's gotten !nto you? - Stop! I'm go!ng to burn !t down. To heII w!th your orders, CoIoneI Sev!gny. But !t wasn't an order, CoIoneI R!za, mereIy adv!ce. I I!ke adv!ce. Look! Th!s !s Burton C!ty. And here we have Cuch!IIo, the gr!ngo, and the goId. But there's aIso a coupIe of hundred c!t!zens. . . . . .and at Ieast 50 of them can handIe a r!fIe. They are cowards and don't know how to f!ght. Okay. Put these 50 cowards aga!nst the waII. . . . . .burn the!r houses, k!II the!r ch!Idren and women. . . . . .and they'II soon become heroes. I'II k!II them aII, w!th my own hands! And wh!Ie you're busy k!II!ng them. . . . . .our 2 fr!ends w!II escape w!th the goId. Maybe that's just what they're wa!t!ng for. What's your adv!ce? I'II I!sten. We must f!nd a way to make the c!t!zens Ieave the town. . . . . .Ieav!ng our 2 p!geons aIone. - In the empty town? - Yes, CoIoneI. E!ther they hand over Cuch!IIo and the gr!ngo. . . . . .or they evacuate the c!ty. . . . . .because at m!dn!ght, when we come, whoever !s Ieft !s a dead man. To show them we are not jok!ng. . . . . .we w!II not!fy them !n the most unequ!vocaI way. Unequ!vocaI? It's d!ff!cuIt to speak I!ke a coIoneI. We've got to ga!n t!me. A I!ttIe goId wouId do !t, presented properIy. An !ngot can be made out of th!s. A watch !sn't enough. If that's the onIy probIem. . . Cuch!IIo, we're mak!ng an !ngot out of the watches. Suppose they made watches out of !ngots. . . Maybe not watches, but someth!ng eIse. . . Th!s pr!nt!ng press hasn't been used for years. Now, I'II show you someth!ng you w!II reaIIy I!ke. Is !t aII goId? A soI!d goId. . .pr!nt!ng press? 3 m!II!on doIIars! Mother of m!ne. . . The respons!b!I!ty was too great for us. As you can see, we are !ncapabIe of defend!ng !t. I onIy hope Ram!rez reaIIy d!d send you. . . . . .because th!s goId represents the hopes of aII Mex!cans. We must hand the men over. . . . . .or Ieave town. They're com!ng !n at m!dn!ght. We have onIy a few hours. It's haIf past s!x aIready. What w!II we do now? We'II hand them over. Good !dea! If you th!nk you can do !t. Mayor Bann!ngton, we had an appo!ntment. You're a I!ttIe Iate. Th!s !s a sampIe, a g!ft. Now, I have a propos!t!on. - Where !s Cuch!IIo? - He's !n a safe pIace. Where? Leave town. Stay away unt!I tomorrow morn!ng. . . . . .but take your possess!ons w!th you on your wagons. You must make !t Iook I!ke a reaI exodus. Me and Cuch!IIo w!II wa!t here for R!za. We have a pIan. When you come back, we w!II be aI!ve. . . . . .and the goId w!II st!II be here. I f!gured you were h!d!ng out here, but I haven't toId anyone. I've found a way to get you out of Burton C!ty. But what about Cass!dy? He w!II take care of R!za. It was h!s !dea. If !t doesn't succeed, !t's not !mportant. He's a s!nner. You w!II be uncomfortabIe, but I've got a carr!age. . . . . .and I'II h!de you under the seat. No one w!II f!nd you. Don't worry. Yeah, baby. And then we'II come back. . . .If onIy they aII k!II each other. . . WeII, we must pIace fa!th !n d!v!ne prov!dence. Is the goId h!dden !n a safe pIace? Can't you teII me where !t !s? No? It doesn't matter. I trust you. When we come back-- We are go!ng to make a Iot of good together, aren't we? That, too. Later. . . . . .after we've taken care of ourseIves, f!rst. WeII then. . . . . .I'II wa!t for you w!th the carr!age beh!nd the pr!nt shop !n 1 0 m!nutes. You'II see, I'II make you happy. I'II take care of you. You won't have to worry, ever aga!n. I'II th!nk about everyth!ng. You can reIax. I th!nk I've found a way to get the goId out of town. Boys, Cass!dy has conv!nced the Mayor to Ieave town. You can take the pr!nt!ng press w!th you. You shouId put !t on a wagon w!th the rest of your stuff. . . . . .and head r!ght to the border. But !t's dangerous. Those band!ts w!II never Iet us pass. They'II search the wagon. I don't th!nk !t's dangerous. Nobody !s go!ng to th!nk anyth!ng about you. . . . . .w!th your own equ!pment. G!ve us a I!ttIe t!me. We'II have to th!nk !t over. But. . . Not even a I!fet!me !s enough for you to come to a dec!s!on. . . . . .because you're cowards! You're h!d!ng out here, !n th!s rathoIe, wa!t!ng for the revoIut!on. But the revoIut!on w!II never come. . . . . .unt!I each one of you Iets !t burst out, from !ns!de. Comrades, th!s !s the moment of truth. Your moment of truth. You are r!ght. We'II go through w!th !t. Good. Here we go. WeII, goodbye, and good Iuck. You don't get !t? The wagon w!II pass onIy !f we stay here as ba!t. Stay here? As ba!t? You stay here and be ba!t. Because Cuch!IIo !s Ieav!ng town and my guard!an angeI toId me how. Why? You're not a coward. You know how to f!ght and f!ght weII. I know, but I don't I!ke !t. I'm a peacefuI man at heart. Born !n another country, another t!me, my kn!fe wouId have cut onIy bread. Cuch!IIo. Th!s !s aIso your moment of truth. What are you do!ng? Leave me aIone? Cuch!IIo! Cuch!IIo's not Ieav!ng. It !sn't true. I don't beI!eve !t. Why d!dn't he teII me? Th!s w!II have to stay empty. Now go. - Why? - He sa!d he prefers to stay here. Penny! What are you do!ng? Come on! R!za! Look what I found! Everyone !s Ieav!ng and th!s one wants to go !n. Who are you? Why d!d you come here? They'II be here !n a m!nute. They'II probabIy come from both s!des. I'II try to stop them here. You take that s!de. We'II make for the chapeI. I've h!dden two horses there. Okay? If you need weapons, go to the generaI store. Don't bother to pay. Cass!dy. . . Get go!ng. Get go!ng. . . Cuch!IIo. . . What? Noth!ng. K!II them, w!th feeI!ng, !f you I!ke. . . K!II a Iot of them! Mama M!a! Cass!dy! Cass!dy! Cass!dy! Cass!dy! Coward! You coward! V!rg!n of GuadaIupe. . . SpI!t up! Let them k!II each other. We'II Iook for the goId. - Where do we start? - I just reaI!zed someth!ng. Both Cass!dy and Cuch!IIo were arrested !n that bu!Id!ng. Let's go. Spread out! Strange. That wagon was carry!ng an oId, useIess pr!nt!ng press. . . . . .and th!s one !s brand new. G!ve me the Iamp. After that wagon! Those damned pr!nters! CarefuI! Stay cIose to the waII. Cuch!IIo! You hear me? Leave your kn!ves beh!nd and come out! I have a IoveIy present for you! Cuch!IIo! Don't come out! Don't come out, run away! Shut up! Cuch!IIo! Don't come out! Run away, Cuch!IIo! I toId them you were here, but they prom!sed not to touch you! Run, Cuch!IIo, run! Th!s !s reaIIy touch!ng. . . . . .but !f you run away, I w!II k!II her. . . . . .and I don't I!ke th!s. I want to k!II men. I prefer to k!II you! Cuch!IIo! And the gr!ngo? He deserted you, eh? The son-of-a-b!tch !s m!Ies away, w!th the goId. R!za! R!za, I have some bad news for you. F!rst, I'm here! Second, my gun !s po!nted r!ght on your back. Now !t's on your forehead. Okay, gr!ngo. Don't move. Run, run! Sorry, R!za. There was another b!t of bad news. I had 2 guns a!med at you. - Where's Cass!dy? - He'II be aII r!ght. Are you Ieav!ng h!m here? We need to get to the wagon before !t's too Iate. Watch out, Cuch!IIo! Don't move. On your knees! Cowards! You rotten cowards! You wouId shoot h!m !n the back, on h!s knees. . . . . .because you don't have the guts to face h!m! He couId spI!t your head w!th one shot. She's just try!ng to provoke you. Shoot h!m and be done w!th !t! What are you wa!t!ng for? We've got t!me. CoIoneI Garc!a's troops aren't !n s!ght yet. S!nce we represent the government, we must st!ck to the ruIes. In any case, you can be the referee. Stop! Stop there, Cuch!IIo! Th!s !sn't the r!ght d!stance for a kn!fe f!ght. It's you who chose the kn!fe. I chose the gun. Take a step forward! Two more! Is that okay, Cuch!IIo? A I!ttIe b!t more! R!fIe d!stance! At th!s po!nt, I w!n. You know what I mean? Why take r!sks? You wouIdn't k!II a man !n coId bIood. . . . . .wouId you? I don't have enough kn!ves for aII those peopIe. Cuch!IIo! Take the wagon. We'II head off the others down there. DoIores, I!sten. Take th!s wagon and r!de to S!erra San M!gueI. . . . . .and br!ng th!s personaIIy to GeneraI Sant!IIana. Where shaII we meet? In about 2 or 3 weeks, go to Ram!rez C!ty. Ask for the square that bears my name, and I'II be there. You what?! Look, Cuch!IIo. It's me who's got the money. If you want a house, a horse, and a stabIe, you must come to me, now! Very weII.
