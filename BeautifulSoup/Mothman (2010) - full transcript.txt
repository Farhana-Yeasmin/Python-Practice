THE LAND POINT PLEASANT IS SITTING ON RIGHT NOW IS THE ONLY LAND IN NORTH AMERICA NEVER TO HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED BY INDIANS. THEY THOUGHT IT WAS INHABITED BY AN EVIL SPIRIT OR SOMETHING, RIGHT? INDEED. AND RIGHTFULLY SO. A BLOODY BATTLE WAS WAGED ON THESE LANDS. HUNDREDS OF INDIANS WERE MASSACRED. THE WHITE SETTLERS SHOWED NO MERCY. THE INDIAN CHIEF CORNSTALK HAD SEEN ENOUGH OF HIS PEOPLE'S BLOOD SHED. SO, HE CROSSED OVER THE RIVER TO WHERE POINT PLEASANT NOW STANDS, AND HE OFFERED THE WHITE SETTLERS A TRUCE. AND THEN THEY MURDERED HIM. WELL, NOT ONLY DID THEY MURDER HIM. THEY TORTURED HIM. NOW, THEY BEAT HIM RELENTLESSLY, WANTING TO KNOW WHERE THE FEW SURVIVORS OF HIS TRIBE WERE HIDING. BEFORE DYING, HE SUMMONED THE EVIL SPIRIT THAT THE INDIANS HAD FEARED FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS SO THAT HE MIGHT SEEK OUT HIS REVENGE AGAINST ANYONE WHO WOULD SET FOOT ON THIS LAND WITH THE BLOOD OF MURDER ON THEIR HANDS. [ RASPING ] BULLETS DID NOTHING TO STOP THIS HORRIFIC TRANSFORMATION, SO THEY PROCEEDED TO CUT HIS BODY INTO PIECES WHILE STILL ALIVE. [ GROANING ] THEY PLACED THE PIECES OF THE CHIEF IN A MIRROR-LINED COFFIN, HOPING IT WOULD TRAP THE SPIRIT. IT DID. NOW MOTHMAN CAN ONLY CROSS INTO OUR WORLD THROUGH REFLECTIVE SURFACES. WELL, I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING REFLECTIVE IN HERE, SO I SEE YOU'VE LEFT NOTHING UP TO CHANCE. IF YOU WANT TO STAY ALIVE, YOU LISTEN TO OLD FRANK HERE. THERE'S AN EVIL IN POINT PLEASANT. [ CHUCKLING ] SURE DO HAVE A LOT OF BOOKS FOR SOMEONE WHO CAN'T SEE TO READ. WELL, I HAVEN'T ALWAYS BEEN BLIND. I COLLECTED A FEW ITEMS OVER THE YEARS. NOW, THIS IS SOME STUFF YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK THROUGH, SO YOU HELP YOURSELF. WELL, GO ON. GO ON, GO TAKE A LOOK. OKAY. LEAVING SO SOON? BE CAREFUL OUT THERE. THERE'S AN EVIL IN POINT PLEASANT. YEAH, I'M BEGINNING TO SEE THAT. NO, YOU'RE NOT. PEOPLE LAUGH AND JOKE AND CARRY ON, BUT THIS IS VERY REAL. LET ME GO. GOOD DAY.

IF THIS IS YOUR SICK IDEA OF A JOKE, IT AIN'T FUNNY. YOU'RE LUCKY I DON'T KICK YOUR ASS RIGHT NOW. THIS ISN'T A JOKE! WE'RE ALL IN DANGER, ALL RIGHT?! DO YOU SEE THIS?! IT COMES THROUGH REFLECTIONS. I DON'T KNOW HOW, BUT IT DOES. I SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES. IF IT HAS A REFLECTION, WE HAVE TO BREAK IT. CASEY, STOP HIM! DAMN IT! [ GRUNTS ] [ CRYING ] YOU KNOW, WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM JARED IN TWO DAYS. WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED WORRYING ABOUT SOME BROKEN MIRRORS, WHY DON'T YOU GO CHECK ON HIM? IF IT ISN'T TOO MUCH TROUBLE. HEY! [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! THAT'S MY TRUCK, MAN! HEY! HEY, WHERE YOU GOING?! [ TIRES SCREECH ] WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M CALLING THE POLICE. NO, DON'T DO THAT. WELL, WHY THE HELL NOT?! WHO'S GONNA PAY FOR ALL THIS, HUH?! YOU KNOW WHAT? DEREK'S RIGHT. YOU CARE MORE ABOUT YOUR STUFF THAN YOU DO OUR FRIENDS. GIVE ME YOUR KEYS. GIVE ME YOUR KEYS! WHERE ARE YOU GOING? TO CHECK ON JARED. YOU DON'T ACTUALLY BELIEVE THIS -- THAT THE MOTHMAN IS REAL, DO YOU? I DON'T KNOW, BABY. BUT RICHARD AND SALLY ARE DEAD, ALL RIGHT?! THEY'RE DEAD! THAT SURE AS HELL IS REAL ENOUGH FOR ME. ALL RIGHT? COME ON. COME ON. [ SOBBING ] COME ON! [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] [ TIRES SCREECHING ] [ ENGINE SHUTS OFF ] [ ELECTRICITY BUZZING ] [ TRUCK DOOR CLOSES ] [ DOOR CREAKS ] I'M COMING IN, FRANK. MMM, SO... IT BECOMES TRANSPARENT AND POWERLESS IN THE SUNLIGHT. ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING. UH, I'M NOT EXACTLY SHARING YOUR ENTHUSIASM HERE. [ CHUCKLES ] ATTAGIRL. [ GROANS ] SO, THIS THING... IT'S AFTER YOU, TOO. ISN'T IT? YOU MUST UNDERSTAND. THE MOTHMAN WILL ONLY ATTEMPT TO ENTER OUR WORLD FOR ONE REASON -- TO BRING JUSTICE -- JUSTICE TO THOSE WHO WOULD HIDE SOMETHING TRULY HORRIBLE... SOMETHING LIKE MURDER. WE KILLED THAT LITTLE BOY. WE NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN DRIVING. [ TIRES SCREECHING, LAUGHTER ] [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] Man: HEY, BATTER, BATTER, BATTER, BATTER, BATTER, BATTER, BATTER, BATTER, BATTER, BATTER, BATTER, BATTER, SWING, BATTER! [ LAUGHTER ] [ TIRES SCREECH ] [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ] WE BURIED HIS LITTLE BODY. AND THE MOTHMAN CAME AFTER YOU. OH. HE CAME AFTER US WITH A VENGEANCE. YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT. WITH NO WARNING. I FOUND THE SECRET, THOUGH. IT'S ALL IN THE EYES. MOTHMAN MUST LOCK EYES WITH THE CONSPIRATORS BEFORE IT FEASTS. THAT'S THE ONLY WAY HE CAN ENTER OUR WORLD. SO, YOU... YES. I BLINDED MYSELF. [ SCREAMING, GROANING ] DESPERATE TIMES... DESPERATE MEASURES. YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS -- YOU HAVE A SECRET, DON'T YOU? THE MOST HORRIBLE MOMENT OF MY WHOLE LIFE. WELL, YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE. LISTEN TO ME, AND LISTEN GOOD. I HAVE SPENT MY ENTIRE ADULT LIFE LEARNING EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT THIS MONSTER. HE WANTS YOU. AND HE WILL NOT STOP UNTIL HIS JUSTICE IS SERVED. SO... THERE'S NO HOPE THEN? I'M YOUR ONLY HOPE. Casey: JARED! JARED, YOU IN THERE, BUDDY? JARED! [ KNOCKING ON DOOR ] JARED! JARED, OPEN UP, BUDDY. WHERE ARE YOU? JARED? JARED, YOU IN HERE, BUDDY? WHERE YOU AT, JARED? OH, MY GOD. [ GROANING ] [ SCREAMING ] [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] COME ON. [ Ringing ] COME ON, PICK UP THE PHONE. [ CELLPHONE RINGING ] MINDY: Hi, this is Mindy. Leave a message at the beep. [ Beep ] MINDY? BABY? IT'S REAL. ALL RIGHT? IT... IT KILLED JARED. NOW, YOU -- YOU NEED TO GET OUT OF THERE. LIKE -- LIKE DEREK SAID, YOU NEED TO GET AWAY FROM ANY REFLECTIONS, ALL RIGHT? PROMISE ME, BABY. YOU NEED TO GET OUT OF THERE. I LOVE YOU. COME ON, PICK UP THE PHONE. [ Ringing ] COME ON. [ CELLPHONE RINGING ] FRANK, UH, WHY IS THIS HAPPENING NOW? I MEAN, IT'S BEEN 10 YEARS. WHY DIDN'T IT COME AFTER US BEFORE? WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S HAPPENING NOW? OH, MY GOD. THIS IS MY FAULT, ISN'T IT? IT'S BECAUSE I CAME BACK TO TOWN. NO. FRANK, DON'T SHOOT, OKAY? HE'S A FRIEND. YOU ALMOST GOT YOURSELF SHOT, SON. YOU'RE THE LEAST OF MY WORRIES RIGHT NOW, OLD MAN. SEEMS LIKE I FOUND ANOTHER TRUE BELIEVER. KATHARINE, THIS ISN'T YOUR FAULT. ACTUALLY, IT IS. [ SIGHS ] MOTHMAN IS TIED TO THIS TOWN LIKE ANY OTHER CREATURE IS TO ITS INHERENT TERRITORY. HE WILL ONLY EMERGE WHEN THE SURVIVING CONSPIRATORS ARE LOCATED IN POINT PLEASANT. SO, YES, KATHARINE, IT CERTAINLY IS YOUR FAULT. FRANK... JUST TELL US WHAT TO DO, PLEASE. I MEAN, CAN WE PAY PENANCE SOMEHOW? THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING WE CAN TRY. YES. THERE IS SOMETHING YOU CAN DO. I'VE ONLY TOLD THIS TO ONE OTHER GROUP, AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO CARRY IT OUT. WAIT, WAIT. THE MOTHMAN WENT AFTER ANOTHER GROUP RECENTLY? 1967. THE SILVER BRIDGE COLLAPSE. THAT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. [ HORNS HONKING ] THERE WAS ANOTHER GROUP LIKE YOURS HIDING A HORRIBLE SECRET. THEY DIDN'T REALIZE THAT YOU CAN'T OUTRUN THE MOTHMAN. THERE IS NO LEAVING POINT PLEASANT ONCE HE HAS YOU IN HIS SIGHTS. [ METAL CREAKING ] [ SCREAMING ] [ SCREAMS ] WHERE WERE THEY HEADED? THEREIN LIES YOUR ONLY HOPE. THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY TO PERFORM THE BANISHING RITUAL. THERE'S A BANISHING RITUAL? WE'RE JUST HEARING ABOUT THIS NOW? THIS DOESN'T INVOLVE GOUGING OUT OUR OWN EYES, DOES IT? IT INVOLVES THIS. WHAT IS THIS? A SECOND CHANCE. THE KEY TO THE RITUAL. THE BOYS ON THE BRIDGE THAT NIGHT, THEY DIDN'T HAVE THIS. EVERYONE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE DEATH, OR AT LEAST THE ONES WHO ARE STILL ALIVE, MUST CUT THEMSELVES ACROSS THEIR HEART WITH THAT KNIFE AND LET THEIR BLOOD DRIP ON THE SPOT WHERE THE MOTHMAN FIRST TOOK FORM, THE SPOT WHERE THE SON OF A BITCH WAS BORN. UNDER THE INCINERATORS AT THE OLD MILL? YOU KNOW THE SPOT? EVERYBODY KNOWS THE SPOT. IT'S AN OLD GHOST STORY. HE'S NO GHOST. YOU'VE SEEN HIM FOR YOURSELF. DO THIS, AND YOU'LL BE RELEASED FROM HIS GRIP. THAT'S THE ONLY PIECE NOT BURIED IN THE MIRRORED COFFIN, PURE OF THE EVIL THAT INHABITS THE REST OF HIS BODY. WHAT IS THAT, BONE? YES, IT IS. ONE OF HIS. THE MOTHMAN'S? THE INDIAN CHIEF'S. HOW DID YOU LEARN ABOUT THIS? FROM THE ANCESTORS OF CHIEF CORNSTALK. CHIEF CORNSTALK. GREAT. GREAT. SO -- SO YOUR ENTIRE PLAN IS BASED ON AN INDIAN MYTH. AN UNTESTED ONE, AT THAT. OF COURSE, YOU COULD ALWAYS JUST CARVE OUT YOUR EYES. WE NEED TO TALK TO THE OTHERS. COME ON. [ CELLPHONE RINGS ] MINDY, BABY, IS THAT YOU? CASEY, IT'S KATHARINE. Katharine. [ SOBBING ] I BELIEVE YOU. IT'S REAL. IT'S REAL! AND IT KILLED JARED! OH, MY GOD, IT KILLED JARED. CASEY... Listen to me -- you have to calm down. W-Where are you? Is it there? NO. GO GET MINDY AND COME MEET UP WITH US RIGHT NOW. NO. NO, HELL NO. WE'RE -- ME AND MINDY, WE'RE GETTING THE HELL OUT OF HERE. NO, NO, THAT DOESN'T WORK, OKAY? SALLY TRIED TO RUN, AND SHE'S DEAD. Meet us at the old mill. You know the spot. WE KNOW HOW TO STOP THIS THING, BUT WE CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT YOU AND MINDY, SO PLEASE JUST TRUST US. YOU BETTER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] DO YOU THINK CASEY AND MINDY ARE GONNA SHOW? BET MY LIFE ON IT. WELL, WE ALREADY HAVE. IT'S BEEN SO LONG. DO YOU REMEMBER THE WAY? UM... YEAH. YEAH, IT'S THROUGH HERE. WHAT WE DID TO JAMIE... WHATEVER HAPPENS, WE DESERVE IT. HOLD THIS. [ METAL CREAKING ] Derek: OH, DAMN, CASEY. WHERE'S MINDY? SHE'S DEAD. IT KILLED HER. I NEVER SHOULD HAVE LEFT HER ALONE. [ METAL CREAKING ] DID YOU BRING ANYBODY ELSE WITH YOU? OKAY, WE GOT TO DO THIS. NOW. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? LISTEN, WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO EXPLAIN, OKAY? YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO TRUST US. [ GRUNTS ] WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THIS IS GONNA WORK? [ SIZZLING ] ADVICE FROM A GUY WHO'S BEEN RUNNING FROM THIS THING FOR OVER 40 YEARS. HE'S THE REAL DEAL, OKAY? HE CUT OUT HIS OWN EYES. WAIT, WAIT, ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THAT BLIND GUY WHO LIVES OUTSIDE OF TOWN? YOU GUYS ARE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS? WELL, DO YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA? [ GRUNTS ] [ SIZZLING ] IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE HAPPENING? YOU GUYS SEE THIS? JUST GIVE IT TO ME. JUST GIVE IT TO ME! [ GRUNTS ] [ SCREAMING ] Derek: KATHARINE! OKAY! RUN! GO! GO, GO, GO! [ RASPING ] WAIT, WAIT. WHERE'S CASEY? WHAT? CASEY! Casey! [ RASPING ] Casey! Casey! [ THUD ] [ GASPS ] [ RASPING ] [ RASPING ] [ GUNSHOT ] [ GUNSHOT ] Casey: SEE? AT THE END OF THE DAY... [ GUN COCKS ] ...IT'S JUST A STUPID BUG. [ MOTHMAN GROWLS ] [ ROARS ] GO, GO, GO! [ GUNSHOT ] COME ON. [ GRUNTING ] COME ON, COME ON, COME ON! [ GUNSHOT ] WAIT, WAIT, WAIT! GO, GO, GO, GO! GET IN, GET IN, GET IN! NO, HE'S STILL UP THERE! JUST GET IN THE CAR! WE CAN'T LEAVE WITHOUT HIM! GO! GO, GET OUT OF HERE! GO! [ SCREAMS ] [ RASPING ] [ TIRES SCREECH ] DON'T WORRY. WE'RE NOT LEAVING HIM BEHIND. [ TIRES SCREECH ] WHERE IS HE? WHERE IS HE? CASEY! GO! GO! GET OUT OF HERE! GO! [ GUNSHOT ] [ RASPING ] RUN! CASEY, RUN! IT'S RIGHT BEHIND YOU! COME ON, MAN! RUN! JUMP! JUMP! COME ON! COME ON, JUMP! JUMP, CASEY! [ GRUNTS ] GO! GO! [ TIRES SCREECH ] [ SCREAMING ] CASEY! DAMN IT! [ SCREAMING CONTINUES ] [ INSECTS CHIRPING ] [ MEAT SQUISHING ] FRANK, IT DIDN'T WORK. THE BANISHING RITUAL, IT DIDN'T WORK. OH, REALLY? YOU SURE YOU DID IT RIGHT? YES. WE FOLLOWED EVERY INSTRUCTION. VERY INTERESTING. "INTERESTING." BECAUSE OF YOU, ANOTHER ONE OF OUR FRIENDS IS DEAD! YOU BROUGHT THIS ON YOURSELVES. YOU'D DO WELL TO REMEMBER THAT. OKAY, LISTEN, FRANK. THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING ELSE THAT CAN HELP US. PLEASE! WE HAVE TO HURRY! ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN. FOLLOW ME. THERE'S ONE MORE THING WE CAN TRY. COME ON. COME ON, FOLLOW ME. LET ME SEE IF I CAN FIND SOME LIGHTS FOR YOU FOLKS. AH, HERE WE GO. I HAVEN'T BEEN DOWN HERE IN A LONG, LONG TIME. I BUILT THIS FOR EMERGENCIES -- AN ESCAPE ROUTE IN CASE I EVER NEEDED TO GET OUT IN A HURRY. WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR YOUR STORIES, FRANK. TRUST ME -- THIS WILL HELP. LADIES FIRST. FRANK, WHAT -- WHAT THE HELL, FRANK?! COME ON! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! FRANK, WHAT'S GOING ON? EVERYBODY THINKS THEY'RE SMARTER THAN OLD FRANK. FRANK, YOU LET US OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW! OR YOU'LL WHAT? YOU'LL KILL ME AND TRY TO COVER IT UP FOR 10 YEARS? YOU KNOW ABOUT JAMIE? THAT'S RIGHT. YOU SEE, I KNOW A LOT ABOUT YOU, BUT YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT ME. THAT LITTLE BOY I TOLD YOU ABOUT? WE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE POLICE BECAUSE THE MAYOR'S SON WAS THE DRIVER. I WAS WILLING TO PAY THE PRICE FOR WHAT I HAD DONE, FOR MY PART IN MY LITTLE BROTHER'S DEATH. BUT THOSE OTHER TWO IN THE CAR THAT DAY? THEY WALKED FREE! THE TOWN TURNED ITS BACK AND ALLOWED THE MAYOR TO PIN THE WHOLE THING ON ME! [ YOUNG FRANK SOBBING ] N-O-O-O-O! WELL, THEY EVENTUALLY GOT THEIRS ON THAT BRIDGE, GOING TO DO THAT FOOLISH BANISHING RITUAL. FRANK, I'M SORRY THAT HAPPENED TO YOU, OKAY? I-I REALLY AM. BUT WE'VE LEARNED OUR LESSON HERE. COME ON! WE'VE SUFFERED ENOUGH! YOU THINK SO, DO YOU? WELL, LISTEN, KIDDIES, THE MOTHMAN AND I HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON -- WE BOTH BELIEVE IN JUSTICE. AND WE BOTH BELIEVE THAT YOU SHOULD DIE. YOU SON OF A BITCH! NOW, I'M GOING TO GO EXPERIENCE POINT PLEASANT FINALLY GETTING WHAT IT DESERVES. NO, FRANK! FRANK? FRANK? FRANK! COME BACK HERE AND OPEN THIS DOOR! OH, NO. [ INSECTS CHIRPING ] [ SCREAMS ] IF IT GETS ME, I NEED YOU TO END IT. I CAN'T DO THAT! YOU HAVE TO. KATHARINE, I CAN'T! [ SCREAMS ] DEREK! DEREK! KATHARINE! GO, KATHARINE! RUN! RUN! [ SCREAMING ] IS IT BEHIND US? THIS WAY. [ GASPS ] KATHARINE? CASEY. Derek: WE THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD. YEAH, SO DID I. I WAS HOPING YOU GUYS WOULD BE HERE. [ RASPING ] [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] GO, GO!
