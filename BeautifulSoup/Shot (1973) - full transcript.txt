Right, Ruby? - I quit though. - Maybe we can line you up with something. - Like What? - Well, we have a few people working kind of clandestinely. You know what I mean? It doesn't amount to too much work. - I don't want to me no goddamn informer. - That's be about enough, Ross. This agency has specific guidelines for the recruitment of special contacts and those guidelines will be adhered to. Do you understand? - Yes, sir. I'm just trying to use every opportunity available to. - Nevermind. We'll discuss this later. - Well, anyway, sir. We did a pretty good job this time, even if Ross did screw up again. - Yeah, you guys had a real test this time. What's that, Wilson? - What? - That, goddamn it. That book up there. - I don't know. I've never seen that before. - Give it here. What's this crap doing in a unit, Wilson? - Someone else must've been reading it, sir. - Don't shit me, Wilson. You guys have been using this car for months now. - Oh, yeah. That's right. - Just keep this kind of crap out of official cars. You get me? - Yes, sir. - It's Wilson's, sir. - Shut up. - Okay. - You two are both treading on very thin ice. I know you think you're a pair of real hot dogs, but after all, there's a limit to how far you can go. You understand? - Yes, sir. - What do you mean hot dogs? - Keep quiet, YOU- Just to show you an example of what I mean, look at this car. It was new when you checked it out, right? - Yes, sir. That's right, sir. - Well, these ashtrays back here look like they've never been emptied. You've got unauthorized stickers on the windshield, a dirty book stuck up under the sun visor, and it smells like puke in here. It may be funny to you guys, but after all, this is an official car. - That stuffs just part of our undercover look, Captain. - All right, I want this goddamn car properly cleaned up the next time I see it. - Right, sir. - Yes, sir. - Hey, listen to this. Youth pulls out own eyes after drug overdose. - What? - Orlando Beach. Police said Monday that William Chuck Johnson pulled out his eyes while suffering the effects of a drug overdose in jail. Johnson, 25, was arrested earlier when he was observed walking naked near an elementary school in Orlando Beach. - Why do you read that crap for? - A drug worker said that Johnson had taken an overdose of PCP, an animal tranquilizer not sold for human use. The spokesman said that he thought Johnson might've obtained the PCP through illegal sources. Illegal sources. He was reported to be in a deeply disturbed state and so impervious to pain that he did not even scream when he pulled out his own eyes. - Jesus Christ. Do you believe all that shit? - Well, I don't know. - Hey. Hi, man. How you doing? - Yeah, how you doing? Hmm, real nice. Yeah, real stylish. - Oh, yeah. It's great, isn't it? I just bought it. - Yeah, it's great. Now shut up. Hey, what you got here? What's this little jewel, huh? - Give me that back. - Woo, look at this. A real hippie toy. Hey, it's made out of plastic, huh? - Don't do that, it'll fly crooked. - Oh, it'll fly crooked. - Come on, man, out it out. It ain't mine. - It ain't mine. - What the hell did you do that for? Now it's ruined. - Oh, yeah. I guess it's no good anymore. It's all busted up. - It wasn't even mine. It belonged to Rosie Sue. - Oh, hey. Hey, I'm really sorry, man. Really. You know, I really am. - Goddamn it. - Goddamn it. Who the hell cares, man? Who's this Rosie Sue, anyway? - She's a waitress here, that's who. - She's a waitress here. Now listen, Micky. I'll tell you what. Now, listen up real good. Me and my friends here, we're gonna wisen you up a bit. Open your eyes, so to speak. YOU dig, my man? - Yeah, Micky. El Dynamito. - You know, I like you, Micky. Yeah, it's true, I do. And I think you could do better. I don't think you're working up to your potential. - What? What do you mean? - Just trust us. We'll help you out. And who knows, we might even need a hand. Yeah, let's go. Hey, listen. Why don't you get that little dude with the green tie to drive you out to the airstrip tomorrow? - Micky? Get serious, man. - No, no, listen. If you run into the pigs, you can say it was his idea. Offer him 20 bucks. - All right, if you say so. - Well, if it isn't my old pal, Peter. The lousy shit. That creep owes me 50 bucks. Claims he's always broke, but look at him sitting there drinking that wine. Goddamn it, I'm gonna collect. - Don't look like he's got much worth collecting. - Oh, hey, man. Far out. What's happening? - Hey, your old man's pretty fuzzed out, isn't he? - He's not my old man. - What's going on? - Blasio's trying to collect from that dude. Shit, them downer freaks ain't got no money. - Well, Peter. You owe me some bread, right? - Um, yeah, man. Um... I wanted to talk to you about that, man. See, I was wondering if maybe I could have a couple of days to get something together, man. Get your bread together. You know what I mean? I just want to say, man. Like, you've really mellowed out, you know what I mean? Like, all these other dudes around here, they all think you're a pig, man. I don't. You've really mellowed out. You know what I mean, man? - That's nice. - While I think of it, man, I was wondering if I couple have a couple of reds. - Yeah, yeah, sure, man. But first, I gotta have a little down payment, you know? - Down payment. Yeah, I know what you mean, man. Except, I haven't got anything. - Yeah, well let's see if that's true. - Now, come on, man. What the fuck is this? I don't deserve that. - Oh, it don't run. The sparrow's face is dirty. Don't look to me like it's worth a shit. - Now, come on, man. Give me that back. That means a lot to me. - Sure, man. Sure. Oh, shit. Now, how in the hell did that happen? - Come on, give me that back. - Hey, is this your old lady, man? - You bastard. Now, give me. Now, that was a shitty thing to do. Now, give me that back. - Hey, look at that. - Hey, we better get out of here. - 676 to headquarters. - Go ahead, 676. - 676 is gonna be talking to a possible 10-96 at the intersection of 17th and McHenry. - 10-4, 676. 655. 6-5-5. - 6-5-5, go ahead. - 6-5-5, Code ten-sixty at 17th and McHenry. - Twice a day. - 632, 10-8. - Roger, 632. - What's up? - Okay, we're going to see a Mr. Daniel Danny Revelli. - I know Danny. He's been busted a couple of times for dealing, hasn't he? - Mm-hmm. Well, according to this, he's moved up. He handles distribution and shit like that. There were 17 raids on the boards this morning and Danny's name's on the list. - Subject does not have any pants on and shot Officer Holman in the face with a water pistol. - 10-4, 632. Report of a 10-10 in progress. - Never had much luck, anyway. I remember he had his name tattooed on his fingers. D-A-N-N-Y. Real nice job, too. Decided to get tough with Moose Cook and Moose Cook bit his little finger off. Now it reads, A-N-N-Y. - Anny. - Yep. He tried to have the letters taken off, but they still show. - 6-11 and six thirty-two are over there. We've got a sex columnist. Sounds like a good one. - Wilson, you've gotta quit buying these day-old donuts. - Any units on the west side? - Yeah, 6-20, I'm clear. - Last seen running south from a market with a large frozen turkey. - 10-4. - What do you think about this, baby? - Come on, Wilson. Let's go. Watch out for that puke there. - Police! - Open up, police! Where is he? Where'd he go? The other door. - Shit, I missed! - Jesus Christ. I didn't know that son of a bitch carried a gun. - Hold it! Stop! Get up. - Careful. Thing might go off. - Move. All right, let's go. We've got your boyfriend downstairs. - I didn't do nothing. - It's okay. This is just routine. - I didn't know he had a gun, honest - Where do you want to print this girl? - I don't use dope, that's for sure. I don't even drink very much. Hey, do I have to go to jail? - I don't know. I'll see. I don't have much to say about this. - Listen, I suppose you'll find out. I've been arrested before. - Nobody's perfect. - What's he doing? - Ah, he thinks he's Dick Tracy. - Picture time. Say cheese. - I'll try to make this brief, okay? You know you're in trouble. We got you on 8-15, possession of over 500 grams, a 20-20, possession of a controlled substance, and a 37-100, interference with police officers. You'll get some time for this one. - But I didn't. - What do you want to do? - Huh? - Do you want to work for us or not? - I don't know. - Wouldn't exactly be a new experience, now would it? - No, I guess not. - So? - Yeah, I'll do it. - Shit, I don't think she knows enough to help us. - Yes, I do. I helped out a lot. - Okay. - But, I mean, are you guys gonna protect me? Some of them guys that hang around with Danny are pretty mean. - You don't have to worry about that. I'll take care of that personally. - Swear to God you won't let them get me. - Yeah, I swear to God I won't let them get you. - Shit. - Ross, how long has it been since you read the book of rules and regulations of this department? - I don't know, Chief. - Well, read it. Pay particular attention to the article in there about hair. You need a haircut, so let's get one. - Yes, sir. Well? - Okay, I'll do it. But what do I get? - You get to go home now. - Yeah, well it's just that I don't have no job right now. - And Danny won't be around. - He ain't shit. - All right, we'll see if we can't get you a little dough. Maybe later on if things work out, we'll get you on the payroll. - Okay, but nobody's gonna find out, right? - Right. - You know, this ain't a bad way to make 20 bucks, is it? - Well, let's go get it. - What's your hurry, man? I mean, there's no way the pigs could be out here yet. - Come on down out of that plane. Come on down out of there. Come on. - Shit, man. What are we gonna do now? - Shut up and let's get out of here. - Car 12 calling Radar 4. - Radar 4, go ahead. - Yeah, I got her set now, Bill. - Roger. Got it clocked at 73. - Okay, I'll be out of car here. - 10-4. - Easy 20 bucks, huh? - Hey, stop whining, squirrel. - 15 to disregard 19. - Hey, what's this, a roadblock? - Nah, it's just a speed trap. Keep going. - That guy's doing over 90. Car 12. Radar 4 to car 12. Radar 4 to car 12. - Hey, what's he trying to do? - Fuck him. Keep going. - Pull over! Hey, stop! - Woo, what's that? - Goddamn. Sergeant's gonna kill me for this. - You gotta be shitting me. - Hey, man. Not so loud, huh? - You just better be glad that that goddamn van was rented with a hot card or you'd be up shit creek right now. - Yeah, well how was I supposed to know the fucking pigs would be out there, man? - You could've looked around before the fucking plane landed, you shithead! - Looked around? Oh, yeah. - Ah, shut up. And who the hell do you think that disguise is gonna fool, anyway? - Well, I don't know, I thought. - Where's that goddamn idiot Micky? - Micky? Well, man, that fucking baby was making so much noise I put him in the trunk. - Good. - Yeah, the pigs are looking for two guys anyway. - All right, take your friend home and stay there till I get there. You got it? - I got it, man. - I've got some business to take care of. - What kind of business? - Beat it! - Hi. Is Mark in? Is Mark in? Hi, how you doing? Goddamn it, is Mark in? ' Uh, yeah, yeah. He's in the back. - Yeah, well nice talking to you. - Hey, look who's here. - Yeah, I thought I'd just drop by with a little something. - That's great. Let's see what you got. - Well, I like to make my deals confidential, if you know what I mean. - Oh. Don't worry about my assistants here. They're quite trustworthy. They work for me. - Yeah, sure. If you say so. - I say so. Fine. Just fine. I've got a little something for you. - It's been a pleasure, I'm sure. - Hey, stick around for a minute. You know, they don't build those cop radar sets for the kind of punishment some people dish out. - What are you talking about? - Don't bullshit me, man. That business out at the airstrip. That was your doing, right? Huh, am I right? See, I was right. - You don't fuck around, do you? - Fun's fun. Takes money, but fun's fun. That's great stuff. That radar business was a real mess all right. Hey, I don't mean to slight you. I know a lot of time and effort went into that and went right down the drain. And leadership and planning too, huh? Great stuff. Hey, I'll tell you what. Will you take that out of here already? Tell you what. I'd like to hear some more about this stuff. I might want a little piece of the action. - Is that right? - That's right. Hey, look. Why don't you stop by in a couple of days? We can talk about it. - Yeah, sure. Catch you later, man. - Yeah. Hey, watch out for radar on the way home, huh? - Say, what are you doing in a liquor store? - Chief told me to take a couple days off. Thought I'd pick up something to pass the time. You're an expert. Is this stuff any good? - There's only one way to find out. Yeah, this is real good. This is fine. - Sure you wouldn't like another sip? - Oh, thanks. It's not that good. - You're right. I'm gonna try some Fiesta. - Hey, your pig pin is crooked. - Thanks. - I wonder if I should go to work. - Go to work? - Yeah. There's nothing wrong with being a professional dancer, is there? - Nah. Where do you work now? - Saibo Club. Same place I worked before I got arrested on a bum wrap. - You mean, plugging your old man? - Yeah, that's right. A clear-cut case of self-defense and they say I gotta go to trial. - You should've taken my advice. We could've worked something out. My recommendations carry a lot of weight. - Is that right? Aren't you gonna pay for that? - Nah. Come on, I'll give you a lift. - Hey, a real police car. What are you doing driving this car? - I don't have a car. I kind of take care of this. - Look at all these fancy gizmos. What's this for? I'd like a hamburger and an order of fries, please. - Hey, come on, goddamn it. - Can you repeat? - 10-22. Why don't you come on downtown and make a quick statement, huh? - About what? - About Little Don and the stuff in his van. - I don't feel like making a statement right now. Why don't you try me a little later? - Yeah, yeah. - Is this your siren? - Isn't this your place here? - Mm-hmm. - What a dump. - Thanks for the ride. - Yeah. - Look at that. Isn't that the chick that shot her old man? - Hey, isn't that that pig that plugged Sammy, man? - Yeah, yeah. Shut up and get the hell in the car. We're gonna have to take care of that. - 29, 10-21. - Yeah, okay. 10-4. - Hello? - Yeah, this is Ross. - I wanted to tell you. - Tell me what? There's gonna be some stuff delivered tomorrow. A lot of stuff. - What stuff? - A big delivery. I'm supposed to go along with a guy, one of Danny's friends. - Who is it? - Some guy with rotten teeth. You should smell his breath. - Where's the stuff at? - I don't know where the stash is, but he's gonna pick me up tomorrow. - You don't know where the stash is stashed? - No, I don't, but I wanted to tell you about it. - That's good. - And you're gonna help me out, right? You're gonna protect me from the guys, aren't you? - Yeah, we're gonna protect you. - Okay then. You said I might get paid, too. - Yeah, we'll see if we can't work something out. - Goodbye. - Roger. I think I've got 'em right now. - Roger, Air-4. According to the info we received yesterday, the car should be a Red and pretty beat up. - 10-4, I have subjects in sight. I have subjects in sight. - Ah, this coffee tastes like shit. Air-4 to unit 29. Suspect vehicle is stopping. - What are you doing? - Roger, Air-4. Have they spotted you? - 10-34, I don't think so. - What are you doing? - That one's mine. It's the bonus I richly deserve. - You're crazy. They're gonna know it's missing. - Oh, shit. Them ying yangs don't know what's going on as long as you don't tell 'em. - Sure. - Now listen, you ain't involved. Just don't say nothing. - Okay, 29. They're moving again. - 10-4. Do you have the suspect vehicle in sight? That's affirmative. They're approaching your location. - 10-4, Air-4. You can 10-7. - Okay. ♪ You know I can't go to the seashore ♪ 'Cause the police got my Chevy ♪ I ain't got much money ♪ And the landlord's after that - They must've turned off. Damn it. Let's go. ♪ 'Cause he listens to my troubles ♪ Course he don't speak no English ♪ Lord, I wonder where I'm at ♪ Those country blues - Think you were followed? - Nah, I was real careful, man. Just one of the things you learn in this business. - Yeah. Hey, what happened to your teeth? - I bet the pigs knocked 'em out, huh? - No, they just fell out. Rotted, I guess. - Yeah, well never mind that. You got it? - Yes, sir. This is it. - Okay. Yeah, real fine, real fine. Except there's one missing. - Huh? No there ain't, man. You must've miscounted. Let me see. - Where is it? - What do you mean? - I mean, this packet is missing and this bundle's been messed with, man. - Shit, man. I don't know. It's just one little packet anyway. - Yeah. Yeah, you got a point there. Except I don't. What do you got to say, little lady? - Yeah, he took one. - Goddamn bitch. - I told you not to, didn't I? - Yeah, she told you not to, didn't she? - That was bad, man. Real bad. - Yeah, real, real bad. - Look, man. I earned that shit. I more than earned it. - You earned something, but not that. - Yeah, not that. - Hey, hey. Hey! Jesus! Goddamn it, let me go! - It's just like a rubber chicken. Except nobody's pulled out his cork. - Hey, he fell. - Hey, he fell. - Yeah, he fell. Jesus Christ. I swear you goddamn butterfingers would screw up a shit sandwich. - Man, you should've seen him splatter. - The pigs! - Come on, damn it! - Jesus, he fell. Open up! - Hey! 10 to one says he's dead. - Well, look who's here. Things got hot, but I guess you outslicked 'em, huh? - Yeah, it looks like it. - Hey, you guys are really crazy. You know, you could've got into some shit over this. How about a drink? - Sure. - Say, how'd that guy happen to fall off that building? - Yeah, he fell like a rubber chicken, didn't he? - Well, what's next for you boys? - Who knows. - I gotta tell you, you did all right for me on this one. - Yeah, well what about Sammy, man? The pigs blew him in half. - Shut up. - And what about that chick that's working with the pigs? - Yeah, yeah. We'll take care of it. Now, just keep quiet. Thank you. - Look, I'm really sorry about your friend. - It's all right, Mark. I can call you Mark, can't I? - Sure. - Well, Mark. It's my idea that me and my friends here... Excuse me a minute, Mark. Goddamn it, Micky! If I told you once, I told you a thousand times, not to fuck around when I'm trying to make an important deal! It's my idea that we take an extended vacation to Canada. Just till things cool off. - That sounds like a good idea. - Mark, I'm gonna be upfront with you on this. We need some bread. And there's an opportunity for us to make a big score on a beautiful investment if we have the backing. It's a thousand percent winner. - And you need some investment capital, huh? - That's right, Mark. It's a beautiful opportunity that just can't miss. - What is it exactly? - A fly in. A big fly in of goodies that'll bring a thousand percent profit. - Come on, man. It's not gonna work. Look what happened the last time. - Yes, it will. Now, the last time was bungled. I'll be the first to admit it. But that's because it wasn't organized properly. Me not being on the scene and all. - That's right, he wasn't there. - So what's gonna be different about this time? - It's gonna be a drop, first of all. None of this landing and takeoff crap. And it's gonna be planned right. We're gonna find a place that's secluded, then we'll use radios. You know, walkie-talkies. We'll have guys watching the road just in case the pigs come along. Everything will be covered. - Where's the drop gonna be? - Out in the sticks. Someplace where a plane can fly pretty low without attracting attention. - Who's gonna be your pilot? The other guy's in jail. - I got a guy I think will do all right. - Yeah, he's just right. - I'll tell you what. I like those thousand percent returns. So, if you can get a pilot, you can count me in. - I think he'll do just fine. - Yeah, unless he gets fried. - Jimbo. Hey, Jimbo. How you doing, man? - Shit, this goddamn place is a drag, man. - Here, you better take this. - Ooh, that's good. The boss said you called. We're not allowed to talk during working hours. - Yeah, I just wanted to ask you something. - What's that? - I was wondering if you still had a pilot's license, man. - Yeah, I still got it. - Well, if you can get hold of a plane, you might be able to earn some bread. Like about 200. - Yeah. 200. - Only it's slightly illegal. - Who the fuck cares? - That's the right attitude, man. Excuse me a minute. Micky, put it down. Good help's hard to find these days. - That sounds good to me. - Good, good. And little Wanda here will be going along to help out. - Yeah, good. I'll take care of it. Just let me know when you want me to do it. But there's just one thing though. - What's that? - I don't want no fucking fried chicken around. - Micky, put it down. - 29er X-Ray to HQ. - Go ahead, 29. - 10-21 this number. 10-21 this number. 3-6-5-3-3-6-5. 365-3365. - 10-4, 29er. - Who's that to? - Ruby. I told her to meet me here at three. - She didn't want to do much talking before. What makes you think she'll talk now? - Sometimes being arrested has a delayed effect on people. It loosens the tongue. Know what I mean? - Ross, we busted that girl. She hates our guts. She's not gonna talk to you. Headquarters to 29 X-ray. - Yeah, go ahead. - 29er, nobody answered on your 10-21. - Okay, 10-4. I wonder where the hell she is? - Hey, did I tell you about the shoplifter I caught last night? She had a 12-pound turkey between her legs. Not only that. - Shut up. There she is. Hi. You're right on time. - I still don't like the idea of meeting out in the open like this. - This is unofficial. - Unofficial? - Well, semi-official. - I don't think this is a very good idea. I gotta go_ - Wait a minute. It might be wise for you to talk to me for a minute. - What about? - About Little Don. - What kind of shit are you trying to hand me? - The only shit involved is what Little Don had in the back of his van. - Yeah, I remember. Only, why should I want to tell you about Little Don? - 'Cause if you don't, I'm gonna rake your ass over the coals in court. - Is that right? - That's right. Let's get in. You drive. - All right. So what about the goddamn court date? - You know, Ruby, sometimes I get the idea that this here's the only real friend I got. - What? - YeP- It's rough fighting crime all the time. Day in, day out. Nobody appreciates what you do. Ain't that right, Wilson? - Yeah, sure. - That's not all. Hell, just the other day the captain got all over my ass about not having my hair out according to regulations. Ain't that a bitch? It's a dog's life. This place is a pile of shit. - Things are tough all over. So what? How about taking me home? - Okay. Got any of this stuff back at your place? - Hey, come on, Ross. We gotta 10-25 back to the station and finish up that report on those two queers you beat up. - Hey, fuck you. I don't want to go back to the station now. - Hey, look, goddamn it. If you wouldn't make so much trouble all the time, we wouldn't have to make out the fucking reports. Shit, Captain Hayes wanted that thing two hours ago. - Big deal. Do it yourself. My spelling's no good anyway. - You're absolutely crazy. You're really a fucking lunatic. - Thanks. - That's disgusting. - You know, Ruby, you're really something. You blow up your old man, then you get mad with me 'cause I happen to carry a gun. - Oh, shit. - Don't go. - I'll be right back. - You really think that hippie can fly a plane good enough? - They let him rent one, didn't they? How's everything look, Number Two? Can you hear me okay, Number Two? - Yeah, I hear you real good. There's nobody around. - Okay. How's it look, Number Three? - Looks good here. - That's a pretty original code you're using there. Number One, Number Two, Number Three. Yeah, it's real tricky. - Look, goddamn it. You can't use names over these things. It's a violation of the statutes. - How about flying planes around with big loads of dope in them? - Don't worry about it. Just get off my ass. - All right. What do I care? - You just better care about this deal. - Know where we are? - Yeah. If we follow that little road down there, we should be all right. - Hey, let's try out some of this stuff back here. - Oh, no. That's just not done while you're flying. - Aw, come on. It'll do you good. Here. - You know, it's funny. You were with your old man when he got busted, right? - I told you he's not my old man. - Yeah. Yeah, okay. But you were there. - That's right. - Why didn't you get busted? - Maybe I hid under the bed. - Bullshit. - Maybe they didn't think I was doing anything wrong. - You better be sure you're not doing anything wrong now, baby. - Woo. That's the El Dynamito. - I told you it'd do you good. - Yeah, sure did. Wow, it sure is beautiful up here, isn't it? - You know, I bet a couple pieces of fried chicken would taste great right now. - Ah, nothing could make that greasy crap look good. - What's the matter? - Nothing. Shit, I was afraid I was lost there for a minute. It's okay now though. I gotta get a grip on myself. - No, you don't. Get a grip on this little devil. - Good, good. Do you hear that? Oh, you goddamn dumb broad. You don't even know what's going on, do you? - We should be coming up on the spot pretty soon now. - Want me to get this stuff ready? - Yeah. Yeah, we're almost there. Goddamn, I feel funny. Not bad, but kind of strange. - This is Number One. Chicken Boy is approaching. I repeat, Chicken Boy is approaching. - Number One. Number One, this is Number Two. Number One, this is Number Two. Number One, this is Number Two. There's a hick in a station wagon heading your way. - How do you get this thing open? - You gotta push on it. - Shit, man. This is hard. - Well, just hold on. We're almost there now. - That's them. - Tell me when you want these things to drop. - Goddamn it. That damn idiot's gonna drive right into the drop. - Okay, let it go now. - Anything you say. - Well, let's get the hell out of here, get this thing parked, and get gone. - Thought you were watching the road, you shithead. - I was. I called and nobody answered. - That useless bitch. - Hey, man. How'd it go? Oh, shit. - Come on, let's get that stuff back. - Did you ever see such a thing? Fella shouldn't be allowed to fly an airplane if he's gonna pull a stunt like that. - Yeah, for sure. - Hey, what is that stuff? - Doesn't concern you. - Oh, yes it does. It concerns the sheriff, too. - Listen, maybe you just better forget you seen us, Jack. - My name ain't Jack and why should I forget I seen you? - Because if you don't, you ain't gonna be eating anymore hog jowls. - Come on, goddamn it. Let's get out of here before something else happens. - What about this guy, man? He's gonna run home and call the pigs. - Then fix his car so he don't go anywhere. Besides, there's no pigs for miles around. - This is your fault! - Come on, let's get out of here! - Air One to 29 X-Ray. Air One to unit 29er X-Ray. - Hand me that, will ya? Go ahead, Air One. - Suspects leaving area in a green 1973 Chrysler Newport. Turned left on County Road 131. Proceed to intercept location. - 10-4. - Air One to 29 X-Ray. Your suspects are moving fast. You're gonna have to hustle to cut 'em off. - Air One, we're at the intercept position. Have subjects passed this location yet? - Sorry, 29er. Suspects have already passed that location. - 10-4. - This party is a real drag. - Hey, I didn't know that those TV guys were gonna be here. - Yeah, what are they doing? - Mr. Chambers, do you feel that the drug rescue center here is a valid answer to our community's drug problems? - Very definitely. Very definitely. Just to look at what the rehabilitation centers like our Zodiac House have done is living proof of what we have accomplished. - Mr. Chambers, what do you feel the future goals of the Zodiac House operation are? - Well, there's kind of a dichotomy of terms here. First of all, we've gotta think of the kids. That's most important. And if we can prevent a crime from happening, maybe we can prevent arrests. Prevention instead of detention. - Hold it, man! This is a private party! Come on, stop! - That stupid jerk. - Well, Perry, let me put it like this plain and simple. If we're going to stop the problem, we've gotta get the pushers off the street and stop the flow of drugs. Excuse me. Will you please excuse me? - Just a second. - What the hell are you doing here? Why didn't you phone like we agreed? - Because something fouled up, man. The pigs are after us. We gotta hide here for a while. - Yeah, man. There are pigs all over the place. - Jesus. You mean the police are following ya? The police are coming here? - Hell, no. We left 'em way back there. We just need a place to hide the car and the dope. Can you dig it? - You want to leave the car here? I guess it'll be all right. Drive it around the side. - Yeah, sure. - Listen. You sure the police don't know you're coming here? - Look, man. We left 'em way back there. They'll never show up here. - This is a private party, goddamn it! - Yeah, but we're the pigs. - Hey, what is that? - I don't know. - What's that? - The Pigs- - Shit. - Police, halt! - What are you shooting at? - Johnny, we gotta make sure there's no dope in the house. - Oh, Mark, screw yourself. I wanna fire this thing. - Son of a bitch. - 29er X-Ray this is Air One. - There's keys in this one. Come on. - I ain't going. - All right. Fine. - You dirty bastard! - Women, man. They're nothing but dead weight. - Yeah, I'll say. - Shut up. - Where'd they go? - Down that way. - All right, don't go anywhere now. - Hey, I think they're catching up with us. Hey, can't this thing go any faster? - Relax. - Air One to 29 X-Ray. We're going in to refuel. We'll be back up and topped off. - Hey, look out for that gate. - Got out of the road. - That son of a bitch. - Hey, I'm hUn9W- _ Shut up. - Hey, watch out for that gate! What the hell are they doing? - Piss on 'em. - Unit 76 will be out at the north side of the stands. - 10-4, 676. - 10-4. - Air One to 29 X-Ray. Do you see suspect vehicle? We lost contact. 29 X-Ray, do you copy, Air One? - Get back here, man. I'm gonna waste this guy. - 29. Headquarters to 29 X-Ray. - Freeze! - Hold it! - Oh, no. - Get out. Get out! On your feet. On your feet! Get up! - If I had my piece, I'd blast you.
