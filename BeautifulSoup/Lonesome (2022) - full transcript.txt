Or are you on your way home from a white-boy country-trade themed party. - I'm not from here. - I figured. - [Casey] Just got here today. - Didn't take long for you to get your big-smoke slut on. Looked like you enjoyed yourself. - I did. (water running) What brings you to Sydney? - I've never seen the ocean. - Never? - Nah. I always wanted to. Thought I'd come check it out. - [Man] Cool. - You live here? - I look after the place and I get a sweet deal on the rent. (dog barking) - You got any food? What do you do? - What do you mean? - You got a job? - [Man] Ah yeah. Right, I work as an i-Tasker. - What's that? - I have a profile on a site. People put up posts of things they want done. You know, odd jobs. Painting, moving furniture, that kind of shit. - That's cool. - It is cool. I get to pick the jobs I want depending on how I feel. Work my own hours. Be my own boss. - Good money? - Decent. I'm saving more than I ever have. Rice milk. It's good for you. - Rice milk? Rice milk. - [Man] You got a job? - Nah. - Maybe I could give you some work some time, could use some extra hands. - Yep. Great. - Look I'm probably not gonna sleep tonight. I'm still feeling pretty wired. Do you want to go to the beach? I could take you to see the ocean. Watch the sun come up? - No mate. I want go on my own. What's your name? - Tib. - Tib? Casey. (Tib laughs) (men panting) (somber music) - Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. There we go. (somber music) (waves crashing) Oi dickhead! Where you going? (somber music) (phone rings) - [Woman] Hello? Casey? I hope you are safe. Where ever you are you should stay there. Your father... I wish you didn't do the things you did. You shouldn't call again. (phone beeps) (somber music) - You got it? Come on. Ah fuck. (man groans) Seem's a pity not to christen it. (men smooching) Need me to drop you off anywhere? I just need to stop by my dad's and pick up some stuff. - I got nowhere to be. (egg breaks) - Yo Josh is dad home? - Dad! - Ah this is Casey. We work together. - All signed. - Thanks. - No worries. Catch ya later. Clean that shit up, ya dickhead. - Jesus. - So that's your Dad? - Yeah. Didn't know I was white did ya? Nah, he's a cunt. He slipped out on my mum when I was about Josh's age and he's got a new family now and I reckon he would rather have nothing to do with us at all. Mum raised me by herself. - Where's your mum? - She got booted out of the country. She never got married to him so I'm a legit bastard. I'm trying to help her get back. She's got to apply for a visa and it is fucking expensive if she doesn't want to wait 40 years to have her case looked at. - So that's what you're saving for? - Yeah. I just needed that cunt to sign some paperwork. - You miss her? - Yeah. - I don't see mine either. - Something happen? - Some shit went down. - You know, if you want we could do some more jobs together. We did good today. We could take on some better paid shit as a team, get you set up. You don't have a place to stay do you? Well, you could crash on my couch if you want. I'm not asking you to marry me. (Casey laughs) (upbeat music) You ever cleaned a pool? - You use a net right? - Nah. More to it than that. Chemicals and PH levels and shit. - PH levels? What's that? - Dunno. Lawn mowing, I fucking hate lawn mowing. You should put some cumin in that. - I'll put some cum in you. - Looks good on you. - [Casey] You like it? - I do like it. - But you really should put some cumin in that. - I know how to cook this. - Okay. Oh this is good. I know this lady. I've done a lot of work for her. She likes me. Oh yes! (drink pouring) You're gonna get smashed. Damn. You know, this is good. - My Dad taught me how to make this. It's the only thing he can cook. He's a cunt. - Cunt makes a good stew. - To cunt dads. - To cunt dads. (glass clinks) (Tib coughs) (phone beeps) Oh sick, we got a job! (upbeat music) Come on corn fed, show me how you boot scoot. (upbeat music) Oh shit! Oh you good. Come on. (upbeat music) (man crashes) (upbeat music) Oh shit. (both laughing) (Casey vomits) You good? (Casey vomits) Oh Jesus! (somber music) (man yawns) (man pants) - Ooh fuck! - Get up. We got work to do. - It's just a bit of general weeding really. Seems like it's an endless battle. Tib planted all of this out. You should have seen it when he started. Oh It was bleak. He's done wonders. - Oh, you've looked after it pretty well. - Oh! I don't do anything at all. I just water it every now and then. Have you done much gardening Casey? - Casey grew up on a farm. - Oh! Is that right? That's lovely. My family used to farm up in Tully in Queensland, sugar cane. - Mine are out west, cattle. - Sydney must be a change of pace for you then. - Yeah. - Well I like your shorts. - They're Tib's. I didn't bring much with me. - Oh that's nice. Oh and there's some fairy lights wrapped around that palm tree. Do you think you might be able to unravel them? - Oh yeah, Sure thing. - That would be wonderful. I'd love that. I had a little here gathering a few weeks ago and I just seem to have them all in a bit of a tangle. - Not a problem. - Such a treasure. I'll bring you out something to drink. Getting hot out here now. You know where everything is Tib? - I do, yeah. Thanks Carol. See the way she was looking at you? She wants a piece of that cowboy dick so bad. (men laughing) C'mon, let's give the lady what she's paying for. - Goodness me. What would my neighbors say when they see you two gorgeous men in my garden? Now, you pop some of this on. You have very fair skin. - That's a great tree Carol. - Oh. Oh yes, yes. It throws out a lot of shade. - Here, I'll grab your back bro. - I was going to cut it down but, oh it's so lovely when it flowers and it just seems to be very very old. Well, give me a coo-ee if you need anything. I'll just be inside. - You know what she's gonna be having for dinner right? - What? - Spit roast. Do you have enough sunscreen on that pretty white skin of yours, hey? - Shut up. - Jesus, these are really knotted. Do you wanna have a go? - Yeah, in a sec. I gotta take a piss. Excuse me! Carol! - Yes dear? - Can I take a piss? Sorry. Can I use your bathroom? - Oh! Yes yes. Of course. Come on in. Just in there. (man urinating) (man sniffs) Your hands. - [Casey] I didn't want to mess up your bathroom. - Don't be silly. (tap running) - This is wonderful. It smells like Rosemary. Smell. - It's nice. - It's like a roast. You two work well together. You seem close. - Yeah. I guess we are. - Oh. No. - Sorry. I thought. - No. No. No. - I'm so sorry. (tap running) - He's a good boy. He reminds me of my son. He's cheeky and a charmer. - Where is your son? - We don't really speak much. I guess I wasn't the most supportive mother. I questioned some of his choices and things turned really bad between us. I think that's why I like having Tib here. He just reminds me of my Adrian. - I'm sure he loves you. He'll come good. - Oh. Thank you Casey. - Is it what you imagined? - Feels bigger than I thought it would. There was this guy I was seeing. He was married. Had a young family. Where I'm from it's not like here. We would meet in his truck, drive out to a paddock where no one was around. It went on for a while. Got lazy I guess. Someone saw us. His wife, she took off with the kids. Everyone knew about it. Everyone blamed me. He blamed me. He ended up driving his truck head on into a semi-trailer, drunk. Both drivers were killed. No one thought it was an accident. I know it wasn't. I ended up back in that paddock with my dad's shotgun in my mouth. - Fuck. - Weird thing though, sitting there, dead set, ready to blow my brains out. I just kept thinking, I've never seen the ocean. I just took off. (seagull cawing) - There's a swimming pool. - Just there? - Yeah, I used to jump it all the time. It's fucking like $25 to get in. You wanna go in? Come on. Let's do it. (somber music) Can you give me a leg up? - Yeah. All right? - Yeah. (somber music) - Hi. Can I help you? - Yeah, Casey here needs to get tested so we can get him on prep. - Okay. Have you been with us before Casey? - [Casey] No. - Do you remember last time you were tested? Have you been tested before? - No. - Okay, that's fine. It's super easy. We just need to know your sexual history. - Oh. Total slut. Absolute cum pig. (laughs) - Okay. Great. We just need you to fill this out and give it back to me and we can get you in straight away. - Does he get the bum swab? - Yes. He does. (Tib laughs) Well your boyfriend can wait out here or he come back in half an hour. - I can take a hint. Yeah. I'll come back. - Right. Follow me. (upbeat music) - How'd you go? How was the bum swab? - Shut up. (Tib laughs) (lip smacking) (water running) (men panting) (tap running) - I gotta call my ma in a minute. - Okay. - It's our date. She goes to my Aunty's every week and we talk. - You want me to go for a walk? Give you some privacy. - [Tib] That okay? - Yeah no worries. I'll go for a wander. - Cheers man. I appreciate it. Hey Mama. (phone rings) - [Woman] Hello? Hello. (phone cuts) - Tib. Can I do anything? (Tib crying) - [Man] Oh, hey man. Hey! (somber music) - You wanna go to the beach later? Bummer, Carol isn't here today. She's never here Tuesdays. Better when she is. I get to work here for a bit extra, get those good tips. - You remind her of her son. - [Tib] What? - She doesn't want to fuck you. She likes having you here because you remind her of her son. - Who told you that? - She did. - Do you want to fuck me? - Nah mate. I'm good. (somber music) (man grunts) (somber music) - Hey. Sorry man, didn't mean to wake you. This is... - Paddy. - Yeah. Paddy. - [Paddy] Sorry to wake you dude. - Don't worry about it. - Hey. You awake? You wanna come play? Come on. Come on. (upbeat music) (men grunts) - He fucking loves it. Fuck yeah. Fuck him! Yeah fuck him. My turn. - [Tib] Oh Shit. - Fuck yeah. - [Casey] Take it easy mate. - He fucking loves it. Such a slut. Fucking pig. (man thuds) - Get the fuck out! - Dude what the fuck? - Get the fuck out. Out. - Maniac fucking psycho! - What the hell are you doing? - He was fucking choking you. - Yeah I was fine. - You didn't look fine. - Jesus. Fuck bro! What the...? I'm gonna have a shower. - Tib. - Not now man. You really freaked him out. You're a fucking animal. (door banging) Fuck, he's back. Just fucking apologize. (door banging) - Open up. Police! - Go out the back door. You don't wan't to be here for this. Go! (door bangs) Hey. How can I help you? - [Cop] We've had a call about a domestic disturbance. - Ah yeah. - [Cop] Do you live here? You get in contact with me if you see him again. - Yes sir. - [Cop] Make sure you do. You might think about if it's a good idea to bring total strangers into your place in the future. - Yep. It was a dumb decision and I was just thinking with my dick. (phone rings) - [Cop] Who's phone is that? - It's mine. - [Cop] Is that him? - No it's ah...it's mum. (phone rings) - [Cop] Okay. We'll be keeping an eye on you. Maybe you should get that and tell your mother what you've been up to. - Yes officer. (phone beeps) - [Voicemail] Message received today at 2:22 pm. - [Woman] I know it's late. I haven't been sleeping well. I just wanted to know you were okay. Everything's okay here. We had some rain so your father is in a better mood, but he's still, well you know what he is like. I should go. You can't call. - [Voicemail] You have one saved message. - [Joe] Listen. You need to calm the fuck down! What the fuck were you thinking? You can't come here. I love my wife. Fuck! I don't know what the fuck you think this is but it's nothing. You get it? You're gonna to ruin my fucking life. Is that what you are trying to do? Don't fucking come here again! - Listen. - Why are you listening to that? - I just had to stand there and lie my fucking arse off and tell them I had no idea who you were. Cops don't treat people like me the way they treat people like you! I'm gonna be on their fucking radar now. - I was trying to protect you! - I'm not your fucking boyfriend. I don't need you to protect me. You're too fucking needy! - You let these assholes treat you like shit! - You can't even see how fucked up you are. You'd rather carry around your guilt like a stone than face the fact that what happened to you wasn't because of you. - Shut up! - It wasn't even real. - You're a fucking whore! - I'd rather be a fucking whore than be in the ground like your last boyfriend! (man thuds) (men thudding) - [Casey] Get the fuck off me! (men thudding) Fuck man! Fuck! Get off! (men thudding) - Get the fuck out! (shoulder bumping) (Tib panting) (upbeat music) (tap running) (upbeat music) - Hey. What's up? Do you remember me? - Yeah? - I remember you. - What's this? - Something stupid. - Something stupid? - Yeah. - I like it. - What else do you like? (upbeat music) (men panting) (man snoring) (somber music) (phone rings) - [Tib] This is Tib. Leave a message. - Thanks. - [Martin] There's a coaster. - Oh sorry. - [Martin] That's Okay. It's just it's bespoke. The table. - Oh, it's really nice. - [Martin] Yes it's by a local artist. He re-contextualizes iconography and mythic imagery into everyday objects. How long you been in Sydney? - Not long. A month or so. - [Martin] Where are you living now? - Haven't found a place yet. Been staying with a friend and moving around a bit. - [Martin] You're working? - Oh yeah. I do i-Tasking. - [Martin] Like odd jobs? - Yeah. I been doing it with a mate but I'm gonna branch out on my own. - [Martin] I see. Is that a fairly regular thing? - Yeah. It's good. - [Martin] The last flatmate I had wasn't great with paying bills on time. I just want to make sure you got a regular income. Look I'll be honest with you. It looks like you haven't seen a shower in a while. - Sorry, I just come from a job. I thought I'd have time to get cleaned up but it went longer than I thought. (dramatic music) (door knocking) Tib! (door banging) (dramatic music) (somber music) - [Man] Oi! Who the fuck are you? - Do you know where Tib is? - Who? - [Casey] The guy who lives here. - Wasn't supposed to be living here. Some trouble with the cops or some shit. He got booted. Now who the fuck are you? - Do you know where he went? - How the fuck am I suppose to know. Oi. Did you bust the door? (bell buzzes) (door knocking) - Hey. - Hey. - Hey I'm pretty high is it cool if we don't talk? - Yeah. Can I charge my phone? - Yeah. Yeah. (upbeat music) - Oh good. You're here. Come in. You gonna need to rinse off. You're a bit fucking ripe. - [Casey] Yeah sorry. - Shower's through here. What happened to you? - Got in a bit of a fight. - Brawling like a fucking caveman. You need sorting out? - I reckon. - Yes sir. - Yes sir. (tap running) - Use that towel there. Don't use my good towels. - Okay. Yes sir. - Don't use too much soap. We don't want you too clean. - [Casey] Yes sir. - Put those on when you're done. I'll be in the kitchen. That's your money. (upbeat music) Good timing. Come in. You can drop your stuff down there. I'll put it through the wash for you. You grab that and follow me. (upbeat music) Put that there. I know no one's hungry, but help yourselves when you are. (upbeat music) - [Man] Who's this? - This little pig has been fighting in the streets. He needs some straightening out. - Looks like he's been fucked up already. - [Man] Is this true boy? You been causing trouble? - Yes sir. - [Man] Turn him around. He's got a nice arse. - Blue says you have a nice arse. What do you say slut? - Thank-you sir. - Spread your cheeks.

You're a guest. Didn't know how you took it but I figured you for a milk and sugar man. - It's great. Thanks. - Hungry. I'm not surprised. You slept most of the day away. - What time is it? - Almost seven. - Shit. Sorry. I didn't mean to crash so hard. - You must have needed it. - I'll get out of your hair. - Do you have somewhere to be? Boyfriend? - No. - Girlfriend? Where do you live? - I'm kind of looking for a place. - Are you staying with friends? - I was, but I had to go from there. - So you're just on the street? - Until I find a place. - I know boys like you. You like it that way, being on your own. - I thought I had something. - Tell me. - A guy, he was married, had kids. - Right. - I just wanted it to be real. I thought it mattered, but I don't think I did. - You enjoyed yourself last night. - Yeah. It was good. It helps me out. - I could help you out some more. You need a place to stay? I got some room here. I work a lot so you'd have the place to yourself quite a bit. 'Course I'd expect some things in return. I have my little gatherings. You'd have to do as you are told. But nothing you wouldn't enjoy. - Yeah that could be good. Yes sir. - You enjoyed it. I saw it. Being treated like shit. You like that. You need that. It would be good for someone like you. (water running) - [Man] I don't know what the fuck you think this is but it's nothing. You get it? You're gonna ruin my fucking life. Is that what you are trying to do? Don't fucking come here again! I will meet you like I said but it's the last time. I can't give you want you want. After this you need to leave me alone. - [Voicemail] To delete message press two. Message deleted. (seagulls cawing) (phone rings) - [Monica] This is Tib. Leave a message. - Hey. I went by your place. Anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry for what I said to you. I was angry and you were right. I just hope you're okay. (bottles crackling) - Man it still smells like shit in here. You need to give that a clean down. I usually give it a wipe, roll it up, lean back here. There should be some cleaning sprays and cloths back here. This space needs sorting out. You can do that, yeah? Here. You'll find something in here. This couch is pretty comfortable to sleep on. There's some space back there where you can keep your stuff. I don't wanna see your shit lying around. I like to keep this room a certain way. Just clean the place up yeah?
