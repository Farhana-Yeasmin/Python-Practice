AN OLGA FILM PRODUCTION Here's the thing with happiness... No, stop. I'll start from the beginning. Just five more minutes. I've gotta be at work early. What? At work? What? What do you mean? Someone new is coming in to learn the ropes, so I can be at the funeral. Zey, I have to go to work. Really. Ah! Your mother and I said our goodbyes. Even if I left with you, you guys need more time. No, we don't. We're totally ready to... leave. Baba, you just went past the laundry room. What? I bring it to you. Should I wash it? - Ah. - Ew, no. - Fia! - You've spoiled that child. And all you do is complain! We need to hurry or we'll be late. Ilyas! Bozcaada. The day we met for the first time. A Turkish love story like no other. She looks so happy there. Like she was ever not happy? Please! You let her talk to me like that? And in those clothes of hers... Like a clown. She wears this to the funeral of her grandmother? You think today is a good day to pretend you're killing her grandfather? He drives her crazy sometimes too. - Yes. - You see? See you later. Come on, you two! I'll be right back. No, seriously, you can do this. Don't worry. Hey, no. Mistakes and problems just happen, okay? Yeah! You wouldn't believe the things I served in the past. Yeah? Uh... Yes. So don't worry, I'll be right there. The new chef. She got jittery. She needed moral support. I haven't heard you laugh like that in a long time. Did you want something? Yes. The priest said we'd have a moment at the grave and... You know me. I can't stand in front of all those people and speak like that. Could you read it? Yes, of course. - Will do. - There... It reads... "Most of you... will remember Katarina Bilići as the wife of Doruk." - "He, her beloved husband..." - Hey, don't worry. I'll take care of it. Okay? Okay, then. So, see you later. - Mrs. Altin! - Oh, Mr. Eddelbüttel. I was hoping to speak to you privately. I've been holding some papers. For you. From your mother. Zeynep, where'd you put it? It's in Croatian. I don't know Croatian. PURCHASE AGREEMENT - ARTICLE 1 PURCHASE AGREEMENT - ARTICLE 1 THE SELLER SELLS AND THE PURCHASER PURCHASES THE FOLLOWING PROPERTY Zeynep! You put out the wrong pants for me. What do you have there? Your mother bought a house in Croatia? She was born there. It was her money, Baba. With Mr. Eddelbüttel? Your mother bought a house with that Casanova from upstairs! No! Mom bought the house on her own. Look! The bank receipt. It cost nearly... She only asked Mr. Eddelbüttel, as a lawyer, to keep the deeds for me until she... Ed-del-büt-tel... That toy boy! Toy boy? The man is 80 and uses a stair lift. Fia! You're still not ready. - I am. - No. Baba's right. You can't go like that. Whatever you want, but it has to be black. First this "Mom wanted a Catholic burial." And now this! Your mother is a stranger to me. Don't say that! She is a stranger to me.

An angel. A woman full of secrets. A double agent. Baba, stop it. You're scaring people. My condolences. - Thank you. - Did you get hold of Dad? - Still not picking up. - Did you try...? Landline? Am I an idiot? You think something happened? My condolences. Amen. Zeynep, I believe you wanted to say a few words. Yes. So, I wanted to say a few words for Mom. But Ilyas, my husband... my husband has the speech! Uh... Is she getting Dad? Why are you just standing here in your druggie clothes? Do something! Mom? Crazy! - Did you see... - No, it's really... Of course I saw it! - Oh my. - Zey! What are you doing here? Shit! My watch stopped. Zey, wait a second. Hey! Zey, I can explain. That laugh. Seriously, Ilyas. Some girl who makes you feel like a teenager for five minutes is more important than being by my side at my mother's funeral? Don't say that, Zey. I loved Kata too. Of course I wanted to be there. But it was... the time, and I... Please don't blame Ilyas, okay? Please. Your mother... I'm so sorry about your mother. You must be so sad. I'm Nora, and I'm new. And, well, I was... just overwhelmed. And... I'm sure he'd have noticed the time if I hadn't been there, but... Usually, I don't cry. But this was my first time alone in a kitchen this size. And... Now it's my fault that he wasn't at your mother's funeral. I am so sorry. Sorry. You see? Can you imagine how exhausting it was? Oh really? You wanna hear about my day? Zey, it's not a competition. If you don't mind, I'll go check if our new chef wants to continue here. And we can talk about the rest later or at home. Yeah. Or maybe not. Uh!

Josip Cega and through the same door I used for last 45 years. Please don't say we slept the whole night in the same bed. Okay. Did you come on a bicycle? What? No! You need something for that... For sick face. This house belongs to Katarina Bilići. How do I even know what's in there? - You don't. - I'm fine. Who is Katarina Bilići to you? She's... was... I'm her daughter. I am sorry for your loss. Josip. Oh hello. Zeynep. Zeynep Altin. Yeah. Nice to meet you, Zeynep. So, you come to live here, Zeynep? Actually, I was thinking... Hold on a minute. I'm the one who needs answers. Why were you sleeping in there? Because I was born in there. - Žarka. - But... But 15 years ago, things were not so good for my family. So I had to sell the house. The lady who bought it told me on phone that I could live here until someone come. You. - Rent-free? - Rent-free. You know that wouldn't hold up in court? Who wants to take this to court? I heard that. What does it mean? The Germans. Construction site, nurses, umbrella... ...big fans of lawyers, contracts. - How quickly can you move out? - How quickly can you move in? Not that it's any of your business, but I'm here to arrange renting it out for something like R & B... - No. - Airbnb? - Yes! - Airbnb? Yes. Airbn... Airbnb. Airbnb! Stop yelling! This is my home! I can do with it what I want. Home? Ha! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... No, it's not home. What you do... You do, you... you make beige, dead place... uh, for sad people to come, do selfies, fly off with 30-euro plane ticket. And you sit in Germany somewhere, take credit card payment. Airbnb, Airbnb... Airbnb... Really, that... Okay, that's it. Hey. It's time to take your stand-up routine somewhere else than my garden, Spartacus! Spartacus? Kind of racist, don't you think? I'd never... I'm Turkish! Huh... Uh, you speak English, German contract, Croatian house, but are Turkish. - Must be very confusing life. - I'd like you to leave now! I did leave your garden. This... this is mine. This here, up to this line, this is mine. I sold the house, not all of the land. Oh my God! I leave for work soon. Feel free to use water. You might want to shower. Hey! Don't go so fast. Oh... Darth Vader. Could barely recognize you with your clothes on. Do you always make fun of people in mourning? No. But I'm willing to make exception. I'm in mourning too because death of my childhood home. Eh... Face looks better. Uh... I was told I could buy clothes here. Only souvenir and for children. But you are unusually short for adult woman. This isn't working for me. Is there someone else who can serve? Yeah, the owner. But he's at his granddaughter's birthday. He will be back in half an hour. Good. I spotted a property agency at the harbor. I'll use that half hour wisely and go inform myself what changes are needed to rent out the house. - Oh Granddad already here. - Oh new customer! How nice. The jury debating "nice." See you at home. Mm. 8 MISSED CALLS - ILYAS Come, let's go, honey. So, do you think she still loves him? Are you following me? Yeah, I work here for 20 years just to follow you here today. - Where don't you work? - Short list. You can leave now and come back at 10:00 p.m. when my shift ends. If only it were that simple. I'm meeting the property agent. - Ah... - Ah... Mrs. Altin? Yes, sorry. My assistant mentioned it's about Cliff Cottage? Cliff Cottage. I will send you waitress with spray for slimy stain. You will need it. I see you've met your neighbor. Can you imagine? He names his chickens. No! I'm telling you, the man's batshit crazy. Doesn't care what people think about him. Get this. A goat escapes when he's naked. Josip chases the goat naked. Even if it does run through a supermarket, hairdresser, and church at high mass. - So he... he's the town kook? - Yes and no. Maria! Everyone loves the goat-fucker. That's the problem. All of the locals. Beats me. He's so... I don't really know. Sure of his moral superiority, I guess. Actually, he's a total asshole! - Yes! Total asshole. - Yes! - Hm. - Mm. - Ay! - But he knew what he was doing when he kept that well on his property. We can look into water delivery if you can't work something out. - Hm. - Renters think they want a unique experience. But they mean, "Where's the espresso maker and flatscreen?" Uh-huh. My half of the bill. I don't want to be... What's the word? - Beholden. - Beholden? - Yes, beholden. - A strong, independent woman. - Yes. - Let's drink to that. Yes.

Too tight! Help, please! I cannot breathe. - Okay, okay! - Help me! Help, please. Yes! Yes! Woosh! You just rip that puppy off! Wow. On behalf of my nation, a big thank you. What can I say? Friction. Or, how do you call it? Spontaneous combustion? Arson. They call it arson. Eat more healthy food, and you will not need scuba suit. You're a difficult man to like. Did anyone ever tell you that? Yes. See? I want you to eat big. You look good. And you smell good too. In case you think this is pick-up, I'm not interested in women. Oh. Thank God. Don't get me wrong. I'm not interested in men either. Life is much more simple without all that stupid love stuff. Love is for fools. Mm! Tangy. What is it? Goat milk butter and sea salt from there. So good. Doesn't matter how much you eat, how round and soft your belly is. Thank you. We have a saying in Croatia. Old hen, good soup. Wow! You did it again. Thank you. Josip told me about the list. Josip? From the store, the owner. He's called Josip? - It was a popular name when we were born. - Okay, okay. He told me your mother was born on the island, but you don't know where. At first, I thought this had been her home. No, no. This was an animal stable at the farm. And when my family bought it 100 years ago, we made it into a house. Your mother, she wanted door painted blue, like the sea. It was her favorite color. Josip, he said you asked for the prices of generators, stove, heaters, lamps, air conditioner, frigigigator... Refrigerator. And? And you don't need any of these things! Are you crazy? Don't shout. Is it crazy to love a perfect house? Perfect? I mean, it's charming. But it's not exactly made a huge journey from a stable to now. No, don't get me wrong. It's sweet how you defend the house. I just don't think you see it clearly! It could do with more light, for instance. Typical city person who does not know how to survive in the heat. You need to keep the sun out. Inside of the house dark, not bright and shiny. - Renters today need more... - Again with the renters! You said your mother was born on the island. You think she left you the house so you can rent it to strangers? And you laugh at fr... frigigirator! And you don't know one word of your mother's own language. You are so full of yourself, aren't you? Mr. I-Have-an-Answer-for-Everything! You know what? You're wrong about one thing. Because this old hen makes no soup! Fia! Is everything all right? There's nothing to eat. What mom laughs when her child is hungry? One who's been trying to get hold of you and is so relieved now that you are managing great by yourself and the only thing you're missing is food, and by the way, you remember Dad? The guy who always makes you laugh? He has a restaurant. And rumor has it they do have food there. So? So what? When are you coming home? Yeah, well, that... that all depends on how everything is going to... Whatever. We just need the van back before I leave for uni. I need to move my stuff. Fia... What's our problem anyway? My problem is that I need the damn van that you took off in! Hey! Where are you going? Miss Altin is not here! Okay. But if you see Zeynep before I do, tell her we've had a crazy big bid for the house! Do you understand? Did you hear me? Lot of money for the house. All right. Why did you tell him everything? What can I say? He ask what you want. He friend. You customer. This no CIA. So I tell him. Okay. I'm sorry. Did you manage to find out more about, you know, delivery dates, prices? Josip said, order canceled. Please say you're talking about yourself in the third person. Hey! Are you in there? Hm. Who would do something like that? Who, Josip, who? Who the hell knows? My old uncle wants me to ask if you see anybody strange in the garden earlier. If you see someone set fire to his best underpants, the ones he keeps for travel and special occasions. We know you are in there. I just saw you a minute ago through the window. It's okay. He doesn't know you are crazy woman who does this. She's not here. Let's go. I can hear the others coming. He also doesn't speak English. Oh! Hi. I didn't realize someone was here. Oh this is the new owner? She's beautiful. Ask her if she has seen anybody. My uncle wants to know why you make modern our family home and destroy island heritage? Well, tell your uncle I'm not a wealthy woman and need to help support my family with the income from renting out this house, which his nephew might have successfully sabotaged had I not found out that he had canceled my order at Josip's! The other Josip. She says she lit up the underwear. - She did it? Ask her why! - Mm-hmm. Why did she do it? He says, "Every house on the island has a soul, a history." "If you can sleep well at night knowing that you are part of killing that for future generations, then okay. Go ahead." Don't wait till your brother steals this one from you. She set the underpants on fire because she's a pyromaniac. If you're okay sleeping outside her door in a tent, then fine. You heard what I said! You've told the same stories for the last 20 years! ♪ I fell in love with you ♪ ♪ I fell in love with you ♪ ♪ I fell in love with you ♪ Hello. What's that? Lavender and honey, sweet. Coriander and celery. Please tell them, I can't remember having ever heard something so beautiful. For me, it would be drunk version of "99 Red Balloons." You're such an idiot! Sit. She asked me to tell you she has never heard anything so beautiful. Thank you, grazie. You know, your song, though, I don't get it. Why 99? Why always everything has to be bigger, more? If you're gonna circle this back to the house renovation, then... No, no, no, no. I'm... I'm serious. When I was a kid, we had these movie nights back at the town hall. One evening, they were showing this French movie. It was about this little boy whose best friend was a red balloon. I fell in love with that balloon. I wanted such a balloon. My next birthday, my father stood in the kitchen. From his pocket, he take this little piece of red rubber. Blows it up, bigger and bigger. It was like magic. It was his love for me. Wait. What about "love is for fools"? Oh... What a fool. What's wrong with you? Your uncle knows I'm married, right? He takes these testosterone pills for last two years. He get frisky. That's why I bought this. When he stays in bed with me inside, it gets intense. Come on. Don't do it! "What I... remember." "What I remember." - Okay. - I'm gonna be sick. You... you will be fine. Try not to think on it. Here, eat. It will make you feel better. Come. You're trying to kill me! I figured, best way to get the house back. So, why you are alone in such a beautiful place? My husband is very busy at work. This simple life of yours is good. I kinda get why you didn't marry. Oh I did marry. You have a wife? She died. That's terrible. - I mean, I'm sorry. I just thought that... - No. It's fine. She left me for my brother first. - Kind of take the sting out of the death. - God, that's... Wow. He died too. Car accident. We were divorced, her and me. They married, moved to the States. Mm... Mm. Why you really here without him? - Truth? - Truth. He's overworked. I'm overworked too, but he never notices. We live with my father who used to be his boss. My mom died. Our daughter has been angry with me since she hit puberty, but adores him. Which is easy 'cause he's not the one who ever told her to do her homework or brush her teeth. I stop shaving my legs and finding his jokes funny. And he laughed with a young woman who has really white teeth. More specific than I expected, but... Seems fixable. - Do you still love him? - Do you still miss her? No, my boat. You first. I guess I only know when I see him again or hear his voice. Something real. I'm so far away from him here. Hello? What? That's an insane amount! No way. No? He didn't pass on the message. Okay. I'll get back to you with a decision. Bye. Why didn't you tell me Conrad came to the house? This kind of money could change all of our lives! You leave your husband because he's overworked and laughs with some woman who has white teeth. And you think nasty gerbil Conrad's big money will save you from your sadness? Conrad's right. You sell yourself as some kind of moral apostle, but you're just as much of a gigantic self-centered bastard as the rest. So, no second piece of fish? You go catch your fish! I go call my husband! - Can you turn that over? - Yes. We have to put the garnishes on. Good? Yeah, great. Hold on. Zey? Ilyas! I just wanted to hear your voice. - I've been worried sick! - Yeah... I located you via your phone or I would've had no idea where you are. I should've just given us another chance to talk things through. You were overworked. Yeah, wait a second. Let me go somewhere else. Zey? Are you feeling better? Yes. Can't we just start over again? I have great news. I got a crazy offer for the house. So I got to thinking, we could sell the house and put the money into the restaurant. Then we could hire more staff, and then we'd have more time for each other again. No! No? I think that... you shouldn't sell the house. It only started after you left. I swear. This isn't about someone else. It's about us. Things haven't been great for a while now. It's not because she's younger. I don't want you to think that. It's been so long since the two of us... What is it? Is your family? Did something happen? What? Your husband? What is it? - How can I switch off location? - How do you do that? I don't know how to turn off the location!

But this morning's old food is still here. I make you something good now. Promise to eat. You should know. One more day, then I will kick the door down and get you. Okay? Hello? Zeynep, are you there? I've been leaving you messages. I met our crazy goat man Josip yesterday. He told me you wanted some time alone. But you know how he says things, right? Thank God! There you are. Okay, so listen. No pressure. But there'll be people coming to see the house soon. Not just buyers who are flying in to look at it before signing. But surveyors, engineers.

You slamming down that wall. Okay, Macron. Put Grandma down. Oh my God! - That... You absolute asshole! - No. Don't listen to him. It's just a pathetic mindfuck of a lonely old man. This is so, so embarrassing. No. So, so wrong. He 12, you in your fifties. I am 49! - Whatever. - Ignore him. - And I'm 25, by the way. - 25? - Yeah. - Are you sure? You look so much older. - Let's call his mother and ask. - Older? Older? You getting the bill, then? Oh yeah, I forgot. You can't! You're welcome. If it had gone any further, you'll be sorry for the rest of your life. Or not. Really? Macron? Using his name as an actual insult? Do you even realize how sexist and offensive that is? - Pretty on point though, right? - And Grandma? Radical measures! I just stopped worse from happening. Every other freaking male world leader, sports star, movie mogul, Silicon Valley billionaire, normal dude, they fuck, they fall in love or marry some babe 25 years younger than them, and the whole bloody world pats them on the back. And Macron falls in love with this beautiful, bright, feisty, wonderful woman 25 years older and the whole world thinks, "Oh, he must be a closet gay." You do see how messed up that is? How small-minded, how ignorant, how... I do! You're right. I wanted to show you something. Also tell you something. And give you something. How do I know that at least one of those things isn't your penis? - You had too much champagne. - I'm having fun. - You did not? - Yeah. - Naughty. Yeah. - No! Next question. Yeah, just shut up. - I say nothing. - But you never do. What do you want to show me? First, give you. You're right. I play games and... It's your life. I can be an asshole sometimes. This is my gift to you. Your mother's diary. WHAT I REMEMBER ...HAVE A HOME, THAT THERE WAS ALWAYS FOOD ON OUR TABLE... Better than penis? - So much better than penis. - I have more not-penis. My uncle, he went to the same school as your mother. Here it is. This was your mother's house. How much? How much is bidding war for me to buy back my home? One million two hundred thousand. It's not the house. It's the land they're interested in. Hm! One more Croatian saying. Relax, not about all the chicken thing. Actually, not a saying, something Croatian author Téa Obreht wrote. "Is your heart a sponge or a fist?" I'm not gonna stand in your way. My half of the garden, if you need it for sale, it's yours. But that's... About time for me to move on. And go back to the harbor. It's late. Um, my bike's there, so... - We can walk together. - Yes. - I can walk you off. - Mm-hm. Okay. OUR TRIPS When you were little, you would always, with every book, read the last page first. You could only ever enjoy a story if you knew the end. And although I hope that you started with the first pages, with my memories of my father and our daily outings on the search for something to eat... ...you probably started here, with my last entry. The memory of the day that these adventures came to an end. Excuse me. Eh, can you show me the way... put... to the monastery? Just go this way. Mm-hm. Okay. The day that I woke up and my father was gone. No one explained to me why. It was just not talked about. It was only later I learned that he, like many others, had left his home to defend our country. So I climbed the highest mountain on the island because I hoped that I could see my father from up there, in case he had gotten lost. I was five years old. In the evening of the very same day, my mom and I fled the island. And when, years later, I met your father, he understood that I did not need any more adventures in my life. He had made it his life's work to ensure that I would always have a home, that there would always be food on our table. That was the world you were born into, my beloved Zeynep. The safe, little world that your father had created for me. We never talk about matters of the heart, you and I. You have always been a daddy's girl. So, in case I die without having told you, I want you to know, I see you. Day after day, you become less yourself, less free, here in this safe, little world of mine. And by having kept one last secret from you, this house, my island, I could at least keep you in the dark just once about how the story truly ends. I have found my happiness. I hope that you will find yours. Mm... You look good. I feel good. Hmph. Fuck. Fuck! Whatever he wants to say to me, I don't wanna hear. Please. He cannot know that I live in a tent. Okay. Don't worry. It's normal that my brother doesn't wanna see or speak to me. Dražen Cega. You must be Mrs. Altin. Yes, but... Yeah, sorry. I came straight from the airport. Too excited. The contract? I'm so happy to be in this old place again. - Amazing view, isn't it? - Does Josip know you made the offer? I tried to speak to him for years. But this is your house now. And luckily, you don't have the same stubborn attachment he has. There are amazing views all around the island. True. But this is the one I grew up looking at. Hey. Hey. What are you doing? I know it's my brother who buys the house. Old friend of his told everyone at the bar. - I cannot live where Dražen lives. - So stay. Josip, I'm not selling. Turns out it's not the kind of place you walk away from easily. I know this. You said he's dead, car accident. A bit harsh. Dead to me. Both of them. I change the death. Sometimes it's car crash, sometimes hang glide accident, shark attack. Depends on the mood. There is something you should know. Before I met you, my heart was... And now? Can you just... Žarka, damn idiot. Get out of here! - Go on. - No, I, I, I... - Now I just feel stupid. - No, what? No. You cannot stop now. Your heart felt like? - Out. - Sorry. Oh, thank God for that! What? Why do everybody think I have sex with it? Never say it out loud! Come here. No, wait. I don't know what you're expecting, but I've only had sex with the same man for the last 30 years. - And before that... - There was before that? Forget I said anything. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I don't know what fireworks you think will happen, but I had sex with my wife, and it was 20 years ago. Yeah. No, that's good. You will be happy with anything. Nicely said. Yeah. No! That's weird. No one? 20 years? There were hook-up things with tourists here and there. I don't remember, was blind drunk. Who knows what sex was like? - Okay. I just wanted to clear that up. - Yeah. - Are we ready now? - Oh totally. Let's do this. No, wait! - What? - So, 20 years ago, she was... Nineteen. No, that memory's still fresh. She weighs 200 pounds, shorter than you, had mustache.

Fia! - I think I'm going blind! - Did you come by yourself? It's not what it looks like. It looks like you and some stranger are sitting naked at the table. Okay, maybe. But Josip is no stranger. He lives in the garden. Well, that's all right, then. Josip. This is a married woman, Josip! Who are you? - Can I talk to you outside? - Yes. Do you want some... Naked breakfast? Really? Do you know how traumatizing it is for a child to see their mother naked with... And at your age! At my age? Okay, I understand that what you saw was a big shock for you, but I hope that one day the only thing you'll remember... is how happy I looked today. Fia, look at me. Look at me! Do you know how good it felt to realize that my happiness is worth as much as the happiness of the people I love? Dad has a girlfriend. I know. But I also know that's not the reason you came all this way to see me. So? Come on, tell me what's going on. You can't just bail like that, Mom! First Grandma leaves me and then you? After your "right to my happiness" speech, that makes me look like a giant baby, but... I'm the one who's leaving. Me! I go to university. You stay home. Those are the rules! Okay. - I think you may need a minute. - Yes. A café at the harbor has Internet. I'll go there and download stuff to make my stay in that room with a hole in the wall more bearable. Hole in the wall? What did you expect? An infinity pool or a flatscreen TV? - What else? - Yeah. Take my bike. Are you all right? And life goes on. I just don't know how. Yeah. Last night was okay. - Look, Josip, I don't know... - It's okay, I understand. Tomorrow night, Franjo will take the ferry to stay with my cousin for three weeks. I'll move to his place. Thank you. I'm gonna go for a swim. Then to work. Just saying, Mom looked really happy. And this Josip guy is pretty hot. Good thing you have your cute, little Nora to fill the void where Mom used to be. ♪ Cold bones ♪ ♪ Yeah, that's my love ♪ ♪ She hides away like a ghost ♪ ♪ Ooh, does she know That we bleed the same? ♪ ♪ Ooh... ♪ Stop grinning. You brought one of Grandma's dresses. Yes. - I miss her. - I miss her too. This whole love thing is totally fucked up. Have you been in love yet? Once. I think I still am. What's his name? Louisa. What kind of mother laughs at her child coming out? Hey, are you that gigolo who steals another man's wife? By the way, I might have told Dad about Josip. - Ah, the laughing man. - What? - No wife who is happy can be stolen. - Ah, finally, he gets it now. Stop it! Josip! Is it true you blocked the agreement between Zeynep and Conrad worth 1.2 million euros? Yes, he sweet-talked Zeynep into saying if she ever sells the house, then to him. - For peanuts! - She said what? Mr. Innocence didn't know about anything. Yeah. Sure. Fuck off, Macron. She was into it. Who was into what? Hey! - She was drunk, you weasel! - One gulp of champagne, goat-fucker! Who had the champagne? Who was into what? Jesus! Your wife into him. Follow the plot, moron. - Oh sorry. - What, "sorry"? - Baba! Ilyas! - I'll show you! What are you doing here? Oh, wow! You look beautiful. - She looks beautiful. - You had your chance, laughing man. What? It's my normal laugh! - So you're Zeynep's father! - Yes. Oh, I worked many years in Turkey! - You did? - Yes. And I knew your wife. She was five years old. I was just four. Hi! It's Fia. - Where did you... - It's okay. She's a lesbian. - Mom! - A what? Lesbian. I know what lesbian is. - When two women are together, you know... - Dad! What? You get me cable TV, I shouldn't watch? That saved me some coming-out talks. You? A lesbian? No way! I'm bisexual, you dick! Her too, sleazeball? What does Dad mean by "her too"? Come on! - Why are you hitting me? - I'm going to barf. We didn't have sex! He just kissed me here. Nothing happened. Good grief, you're such a drama queen! - Didn't know you could do it. - Well, I can. Thank you all for being here, but I didn't invite you. So this is what's going to happen. We're all gonna calm down. We'll have a lovely meal together, and then you leave. Fia, of course this is your home too. You stay as long as you like. Your choice. Josip, you said that Franjo will be taking the late ferry. Could my father and Ilyas follow him? Yeah. Ilyas. The van is parked in the parking lot at the mainland port. We can talk before you leave. I don't understand. Say all that again in Turkish. No, Baba. Fia and I go get the food. So take a rest. You will be doing the cooking later. - Sounds good to me. - I could live with that, yeah. Wow. Hold on. Do you know how to do that? Drive a boat? No. But I've watched someone who does. I feel safer already. She's taking the boat. She doesn't know how to sail. She's a strong German. Can do everything. - She's a Turkish woman. - Daughter half Croatia. - What? I don't understand him. - Probably for the best, really. The best view in the whole world. Were you blind while you were working in Turkey? This could take a while. If you want, I can go buy us some beers. Yeah, you go. Best idea yet. Take flashy-pants with you. He can pay. Why are you telling people that Lucija and I are dead? You live in Florida. What's the difference? Well, then, how about some nibbles? - Hi there. - Hi. - Oi, here. - All right, yeah. - Whatcha doing? - Just setting up a table. Nice. You must be freezing. Actually, I'm not that cold. - You're cool? - Yeah, I'm good. - Want my jacket? - No. I never took it off. Not even for a second. Is that supposed to make me feel better? I did kind of hope so. Mm. - The big boy's spoken. - Oh. Where is it? I think I threw it away. Huh. We'll get you a new one. Honestly, I don't know about that. - How do you manage that? - What? Finding each other again after you've lost one another. You just do it. Thirty years in the kitchen and he still doesn't know how to cut onions. - Watch out. - May I? Go ahead. Maybe I should have retired earlier and given Kata a home like this one. Baba, you gave her love and security. You were her home. Well said. But when I say a home like this, of course I mean a house in Turkey. - Of course you mean Turkey. - What do we do with these? Most of you here will remember Katarina Bilići as the wife of... Katarina Bilići bought a house. The woman Katarina. The quiet magician. A final act in a life of seeing without judgment, living without regrets, and loving without limits. For this... and another thousand reasons, I am blessed... to be my mother's daughter. To Katarina Bilići! - My wife. - I see you, Mom. And I see me too. I didn't understand much, but... Delicious!
